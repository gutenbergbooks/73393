<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p>
A young engineer stood at the gates of the
electric power house yard watching the sun set.
It was the middle of June, in the north of Scotland,
where the summer days are very long and very
beautiful.
</p>

<p>
The sun sank slowly behind a little wooded hill,
throwing into strong relief a clump of fir trees at the
summit, and making lanes of golden light along the
sparkling rushing river where the silver salmon leapt
in sportive joy.  As the last edge of the sun
disappeared behind the hill, a sudden hush seemed to
descend on all the land.  The power house was about
a mile from the little town that nestled at the foot of
the hills.  It was a bare, brick building standing alone
on the river-bank in the middle of a large tract of
waste moorland.  Inside, a stalwart, bearded highlander
sat on a box eating his "piece," and drinking
tea from a can; he and the young engineer at the
door were the only occupants of the place.  There
was no machinery running, a battery was doing the
work, for the needs of this little town in summer time
were very small.
</p>

<p>
The young man at the door gazed around him enchanted
with the beauty of the evening; the sudden
hush that fell on everything seemed to strike him too.
He felt subdued with a great awe, the great and awful
majesty of Nature seemed thrust upon him suddenly;
only the faint rustle of the long grass near the water
served to make the stillness more intense; some crisis
in Nature seemed impending.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a strange note struck his ear, and
immediately afterwards all the usual sounds of life
started afresh; a robin and a thrush commenced
to sing simultaneously, several birds started chirping
all around, a salmon splashed heavily in the river,
the distant moo of a cow was borne in upon his ears,
the Scotsman inside moved his box with a harsh creak:
all these things seemed to start off at once, as though
some tension were removed, some crisis past.
</p>

<p>
The engineer looked in the direction of the sound
that had at first broken the stillness and perceived a
young girl, with a basket on her arm, raking over the
heaps of ashes outside the boiler-house in search of
stray bits of coal or coke.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her intently, with an unusual interest.
There was a gipsy camp not far off, and some members
of the tribe were usually hovering round the works
for what they could pick up; as a rule they were very
young and very dirty.  This girl seemed about
seventeen, and somewhat clean; every movement showed
graceful, even lines.  He strolled towards her.
</p>

<p>
"Looking for coal?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," she answered.
</p>

<p>
She stood up and looked him in the eyes steadily.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her steadily too, and so they stood;
brown eyes gazing into grey.  He wondered greatly
at the singular clearness of hers, big, and of a marvellous
shade of dark brown, the white absolutely clear;
the colour like some beautifully tinted crystal.  He
noticed eyes, and he gazed into hers for some time,
dispassionately, as something inanimate, noting their
marvellous perfection.
</p>

<p>
He smiled with pleasure, and instantly noted a
gleam of pleasure in her eyes also.  Then he shifted
his gaze and took in a general impression of the face.
It was remarkably beautiful, every feature was even
and in perfect harmony.  The eyebrows were delicately
pencilled lines of deepest black.  The eyelashes
unusually long, they drooped downwards, and
as he looked at her, the whole head took a gentle bend
downwards in natural and graceful modesty before
the open admiration in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You won't find much there.  Come over here,"
he said.  He led the way to the coal heap.  She
followed in silence.
</p>

<p>
"Help yourself," he said grandly, with a wave of
the arm, giving away what didn't belong to him.  As
a general rule he was consistently conscientious in
these details, but under the influence of those eyes
he cast honesty to the four winds of heaven.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir," she said, and stooped to fill her
basket.
</p>

<p>
The graceful movements and even poise of her
figure appealed to him immensely.  He was somewhat
of an athlete, and he noted with pleasure the firm
fulness of the arms (which were bare to the elbow),
and the throat and neck (which were quite unprotected).
Her jet black hair hung down below her waist in heavy,
wavy tresses.  Her short black skirt (faded to almost
a light green) showed a neat ankle and fair proportion
of shapely leg.  He stood back and watched her
closely.  The skin, where it was visible about the face
and throat, was rather dark, probably dirty, he thought,
yet it did not seem offensive, though he was usually
fastidious in such things.  He took life very seriously
did this young man, very seriously indeed; he was
bent on making his fortune, his fortune and a
name&mdash;nothing less.  He was nineteen; older than his years
in many things, younger in a lot.
</p>

<p>
The gipsy girl stood up.  "Thank you, sir," she
said again, and moved haltingly towards the gate,
glancing up at him with her big brown eyes and
dropping them again as she caught his.
</p>

<p>
"Don't go!" he said, stepping forward.  "Put
that basket down and come in and have a look
at the engines.  Have you ever seen a dynamo?
An electric machine, you know.  Thing that
makes the light for those big lamps in the
street."
</p>

<p>
"I've seen them at the shows."
</p>

<p>
"Shows?" he repeated, questioningly.
</p>

<p>
"Roundabouts," she explained.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" he said.  "That's nothing.  Come in here!"
</p>

<p>
She put down the basket and followed him with a
look of pleasure.  She glanced furtively at the roof
as they passed through the doorway, and stepped
quickly close up to him, her eyes rolled widely round
in obvious apprehension.  He looked at her with
amusement.
</p>

<p>
She caught his eye and smiled too.  "Lovely,"
she said, as she glanced round the clean and well-kept
little engine-room.  "Lovely," she repeated, as her
eyes were held by the bright lacquered copper switches
and instruments set on the enamelled slate switchboard.
</p>

<p>
"It's like a church."
</p>

<p>
He looked at her quickly.  "Have you ever been
to church?"
</p>

<p>
"I've been inside and I've looked in through the
windows," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"What do you do on Sundays?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing."
</p>

<p>
"I work on Sundays, the same as any other day,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"It's wicked to work on Sunday," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Or any other time," he added, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Gipsies don't do much work," she admitted,
smiling too.
</p>

<p>
"I think I'll turn gipsy."
</p>

<p>
"You'll go a long way before you see gipsies your
colour," she said, glancing at his fresh face and light
brown hair.
</p>

<p>
He held out his hand suddenly.  "Look here!
Tell my fortune, will you?"
</p>

<p>
She took him by the wrist and gazed at his palm
earnestly for some minutes seeming to feel his pulse
all the while.
</p>

<p>
"Good," she said, "very good," and dropping his
hand, moved to the door.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her curiously, the fun had faded from
her face, the liquid eyes seemed heavily shaded with
sorrow.  He stepped after her.
</p>

<p>
"Do you people really believe what you say?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Good, very good&mdash;for you," she answered,
and passed through the door.  With the sky overhead
and the air of heaven on her face, she altered at
once.  "Thank you, sir, for the coal."  She smiled
brightly.
</p>

<p>
"Don't mention it," he said.  "Come over again,
will you?  I want to talk to you."  He looked into
her eyes and she flushed with pleasure under the tan,
or dirt, whichever it was.
</p>

<p>
He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out a cake
of chocolate (that was one of the things in which he
was younger than his years).  "I say, do you eat
chocolate?"
</p>

<p>
She took it shyly.
</p>

<p>
He watched her bite a piece off and noticed the
even regularity of her teeth, and the perfect shape of
her mouth, though the lips were somewhat full.
</p>

<p>
"When will you come again?  To-morrow?  Oh!
I forgot!  To-morrow I shall be on all night.  Will
you come over early in the morning, or any time
between midnight and eight o'clock in the morning?
I'll bring you down some chocolate, if you like it."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Will you come?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered, and her head took a gentle
droop downwards, half averted, the long lashes swept
her cheek and a rich red flushed beneath the russet
brown of her skin.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her with pleasure, he felt his own
colour rising a little too.  He experienced a strange
thrill, he felt older somehow, a sense of responsibility,
of protection.
</p>

<p>
She turned and went away, glancing back over her
shoulder as she went.
</p>

<p>
He went inside, and spoke to the Scotsman.  "We'll
put the engine on now, Mac."  He busied himself
with the engine and the switchboard.  The girl was
lost to sight and memory, but a sense, a something
remained.
</p>

<p>
Next day the young engineer went on duty at
midnight; he passed the gipsy camp on his way; four
caravans stood silent and dark, and five ragged tents
showed faint and ghostly in the moonlight, a fire
smouldered in one corner.  At the works he relieved
another young man like himself, and the bearded
highlander.  They put on their hats and coats and
bade him good-night, and he was left alone, all alone
in the dimly lighted engine room with nothing running,
everything still, except for the ghostly, uncanny
rattle of the steam condensing in the now idle steam
pipes.
</p>

<p>
Going into the little room which served as office,
mess room, and test room combined, he took off his
hat and coat and rolled back his shirt sleeves.  He
was a well built young man, standing just on six feet
in his boots, with regular, handsome features and
strong, prominent chin and nose; the arms that he
exposed to view were substantial and very muscular,
the hands were spread by the use of hand tools, they
were not pretty, but very strong and serviceable.
He walked briskly out and carefully looked all round&mdash;the
plant, the switchboard, the engines, the recording
instrument, the battery and boilers; he opened
the furnace doors and gazed in at the fires to see that
they were properly "banked;" then he went round
with a scribbling block and took the meter readings,
carefully entering them in the log book; then he opened
the door and stepped out into the northern summer
night.
</p>

<p>
He looked round on the fair prospect with extreme
pleasure, the hills all round with the mountains in the
background, the irregular patches of wood, the few
straggling houses showing white and distinct in the
moonlight, the little town close by with its few
twinkling lights; all spoke to him of peace and pleasure
yet strangely, too, of ambition.  He would own one of
those houses on the hillside as a summer resort.  Time
would tell, he had no doubt, he was quite confident,
he felt it in him.  He worked while other fellows
played.  Worked!  Lord!  Yes! he stoked boilers
and drove engines, he cleaned brass work and did
navvies' work, all for ten shillings per week.  He
smiled, the idea did not depress him in the least.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the figure of a girl appeared round the
corner of the building.  The gipsy girl, he knew her
figure at once.  He knew she would come, but he
had not expected her at this hour.
</p>

<p>
She advanced slowly, shyly; as she turned the
corner she had been active, full of life; she seemed
to droop as she caught sight of him standing alone in
his shirt sleeves in the moonlight.  She came close up
and stood before him.
</p>

<p>
"I've come," she said.
</p>

<p>
She raised her eyes and looked into his&mdash;they seemed
all alight, veritably to sparkle like gems.
</p>

<p>
He was rather taken aback, but did not show it;
his features were impassive, he also felt a tingling of
the pulses, and his eyes showed that as he looked into
hers.
</p>

<p>
"Come inside," he said; he led the way, he wanted
time to think.
</p>

<p>
"This way," he continued.  She followed him, a
pace to the rear.
</p>

<p>
He led the way into the little office and pulled out a
chair.  "Sit down," he said.
</p>

<p>
She sat down, somewhat uncomfortably, somewhat
nervously, as one who was not used to it.
</p>

<p>
Going to his coat hanging on the wall he took a
packet of chocolate from it.  She watched him with
a sort of dog-like observance.
</p>

<p>
"Here you are," he said.  He handed her the
chocolate, drew another chair out, and sat down facing
her.
</p>

<p>
"What have you been doing all day?"
</p>

<p>
"Gathering sticks," she answered.  He noticed
that she did not speak with her mouth full, it seemed
a natural refinement, perhaps because she observed
him carefully finish munching a piece of chocolate
before he put the question to her&mdash;anyhow she did
the same.
</p>

<p>
They sat and looked at each other in silence for some
minutes.  He was observing her very closely; he
noticed that her hands were clean, comparatively;
they were not large and very well shaped, it was obvious
that she did not do much work; everything about her
denoted natural grace and, it seemed to him, refinement;
but ever and anon her eyes rolled widely round,
taking in everything; in this confined atmosphere,
sitting on this made-to-order chair, she was obviously
not at ease.
</p>

<p>
He drew his chair up closer to her and looked into
her eyes.  "You're very beautiful.  Are all gipsy
girls beautiful?"
</p>

<p>
She flushed, gave her head a little toss, slightly
imperious.  "My mother is the Queen of the gipsies."
</p>

<p>
"Then you are a princess.  You look it.  Tell me
what you do all day."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," she answered, simply.
</p>

<p>
"That's good," he laughed.
</p>

<p>
"What do you do?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Everything," he said, and laughed again.
</p>

<p>
"Where do you come from?"
</p>

<p>
"England, the south of England, Gloucestershire.
Have you been there?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered.  "I've been through
Gloucestershire and Somersetshire and Devonshire
and Warwickshire and Staffordshire.  I've been all
round England and Scotland."
</p>

<p>
His eyes lighted up.  "Have you been to
Cheltenham?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said, and told him about it and the
country round; she seemed to have observed everything.
They talked of the counties and the people,
the fields and the woods, the birds and beasts, till
she stood up and pushed the chair back.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like this&mdash;let's go out and sit on the wall
by the river."
</p>

<p>
So they went outside and sat on the little low wall
with the smooth cement top that marked the tunnel
where the water pipes went into the works.
</p>

<p>
They sat down side by side, eating chocolates and
saying nothing, looking at the east and watching the
sky begin to lighten with the first faint indication of
dawn.  All was hushed, and silent the river at their
feet swirled past in glassy, rapid smoothness, on the
opposite bank the sedges stirred and rustled stealthily,
just moved by the scarcely perceptible breeze.
</p>

<p>
They sat there for a long time, exchanging occasional
remarks and lapsing long between replies.  The
spirit of the night, the silent, pensive night, seemed
on the girl and he did not want to talk.  The cloak of
peace was around her; she was at one with nature;
she laughed in the sunshine and wept in the rain.  To
the young engineer the silence of the night had a very
different message; this universal peace and stillness
spoke to him, somehow, of strife, vigorous strife, of
great difficulties attempted and overcome, of progress,
eternal progress; he made many resolves of what he
would do, and the more he had done, the more, he
felt, he would be able to enjoy these moments of rest
and reflection.  Some day he would marry, and this
was the sort of girl he would like, a refined and
educated edition of this; some one with a soul, a
mind, and a body, not a mere clothes-horse.  Her
remarks had shown a natural refinement, a depth of
feeling and thought that exactly suited his own, she
appreciated nature and that was the foundation of
all things to him.
</p>

<p>
The dawn was rapidly brightening; on the opposite
side of the river a stoat poked an inquiring nose through
the long grass at the top of the bank.  Silently the
girl gripped his arm and pointed to it, together they
watched it come cautiously into full view sniffing the
air; very slowly, very cautiously, it made its way, its
head upraised, moving with a graceful swaying motion
from side to side; it was the caution of the pursuer
and not of the pursued, there was no terror in it.  The
young engineer watched it in fascination, then it
disappeared again in the grass.
</p>

<p>
"The stoat gets a better time than the rabbit,"
he propounded, after a thoughtful pause.
</p>

<p>
"Rabbits!" she said, in disgust, "rabbits are good
to eat, that's all.  Everything kills rabbits, they play
and play and never think&mdash;I've watched them for
hours and hours."
</p>

<p>
He jumped up.  "I must go and have a look round
inside now."  He looked at her steadily with approval,
and more; there was a light in her eyes as she looked
up at him too.
</p>

<p>
"Will you come over to-morrow night?" he asked.
There was a touch of suspense in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye then," he held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
She took it somewhat shyly.
</p>

<p>
He held her rather long, looking at her thoughtfully,
he seemed in doubt, then he slowly released her hand
and turned away.  "Good-bye till to-morrow then,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye," she answered.
</p>

<p>
Next night he was outside before half-past twelve,
waiting.  He saw her leave the camp and come towards
him springing lightly from tuft to tuft over the rough
ground.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" she said, and looked up at him, her
wondrous eyes beaming pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"How are you?" he answered, gravely, shaking
hands.  The limitations of the Englishman bound
him fast.  "Come inside," he continued.
</p>

<p>
She drew back with a little expression of repugnance.
"I don't like houses," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I've got some sweets in there.  Come in and get
them, and then we'll go outside again."
</p>

<p>
She followed him meekly, and he took her into the
little office and tilted the contents of four different
little bags on to a clean newspaper.
</p>

<p>
"There you are!" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she exclaimed, with childish glee.
</p>

<p>
He shovelled them into the bags again and handed
them to her.
</p>

<p>
"There you are, those are for you; now we'll go
outside."
</p>

<p>
"You take some too."  She opened the bags and
held them out to him.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," he answered, gravely selecting two or
three from each packet.
</p>

<p>
They walked in silence to the door, then he paused
under the lamp.  "Look here, you never told my
fortune.  Finish it, will you?"
</p>

<p>
She stopped and looked at the hand he held out
under the light.  "I don't know very much yet.
You're very strong."
</p>

<p>
"Fairly," he agreed, doubling up his biceps.  "You
said I had a good fortune.  How do you know that?"
</p>

<p>
"By the feel," she answered.  She took him by the
wrist again and seemed lost in wonder.  "Think of
what you'd like," she said.
</p>

<p>
He shut his eyes and conjured up his favourite
vision.  A great industrial centre; a huge machinery
shop; teeming workmen, strong and greasy; and
himself in the centre, thinking, feeling, living for it all.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she said.
</p>

<p>
He opened his eyes to find her gazing at him in
open wonder and astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Have you ever had a wild rabbit in your hands
and felt its heart beat?"
</p>

<p>
"Can't say that I have."
</p>

<p>
"I have.  And a weasel and a stoat with their
heads tied.  And cats and dogs and birds and all
sorts.  You feel like a dog, a trained fighting dog
when he's going to fight&mdash;and win."
</p>

<p>
He smiled, somewhat indulgently.  "Very probably,"
he said.  "I'm a bit of a sportsman, football,
and that sort of thing, you know.  I've got a pistol
in there; I put in time shooting rats along the river
bank when I'm by myself and not reading."
</p>

<p>
"Come on down by the river bank now and I'll
show you some birds' nests.  I found them to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Wait till it gets lighter," he answered.  "We'll
climb up that hill and watch the sun rise."
</p>

<p>
So they started off together across the intervening
space of moorland, the tall athletic young man and
the slender graceful girl, and the great silver moon
looked down at it all with a parental smile, as he has
on countless such scenes since the birth of man.
</p>

<p>
"I'll race you," the engineer said.
</p>

<p>
"All right," she answered, and broke into a run,
bounding lightly over the rough ground like a young
deer.  But the trained athlete kept pace with her
easily, he did not pass her, but kept a pace behind;
she glanced back and sprinted faster; still he hung
on her rear till they were within a hundred yards of
the hill.
</p>

<p>
"A final spurt," he said, and she bounded away
again.  He could have passed her then, too, but he
did not.
</p>

<p>
"I won," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you won," he agreed, looking at her with
marked approval.  Her head was thrown back a
little and her breast heaved steadily, taking great deep
long, breaths.  She was slightly flushed and her eyes
sparkled brightly.  They had run a quarter of a mile,
and without a pause they went straight up the hill
taking it quickly and easily.
</p>

<p>
It took them a quarter of an hour to get to the top,
up the zigzag, stony pathway through the pine wood.
She led the way and brought him out to a little
clearing at the head of a miniature precipice.
</p>

<p>
"There!" she said, and pointed up the valley of
the river straight at the lightening dawn.
</p>

<p>
"Grand!" he ejaculated, and they sat down side
by side on the bed of soft brown pine needles where
the ground sloped gradually towards the cliff.  The
deep gloom of the pine wood closed behind them like
a curtain; down below, at their feet, they could see
the tops of the trees in the gorge; out in front spread
the beautiful valley with the silent river threading
its way down the heart of it.
</p>

<p>
They sat and gazed in silence, listening to the
indistinct rustle of nocturnal life in the wood behind
them, and the air above: a rustle of leaves, a faint
crackle of twigs, a little scream, and some woodland
tragedy was past and gone, some tiny life was
sped.
</p>

<p>
An owl hooted above them many times, long-drawn,
awe-inspiring, suited to the night.
</p>

<p>
"That's a brown owl," she said.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know it's not a barn owl?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him in wonder.  "Why! it's a
different tune."
</p>

<p>
"Tune?" he repeated, in amusement.  "I didn't
know there was any difference," he added,
apologetically.
</p>

<p>
"Listen!" she commanded, holding his arm
suddenly.  There was a flutter of wings in a tree not
far away, a little agonized scream, then all was silent.
"That's a weasel, or a stoat got a bird," she explained.
</p>

<p>
"Weasels don't climb trees," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Don't they?" she asked, in amused sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know," he admitted, meekly.
</p>

<p>
The dawn was brightening rapidly, lighting up all
the valley, turning the sombre river to a thread of
silver, throwing out the white farmhouses into strong
relief, stirring birds and beasts to a new life.
</p>

<p>
They stood up and gazed over it enchanted.
</p>

<p>
"Look at that man!" she said.
</p>

<p>
He followed the direction of her finger.  "I can't
see a man."
</p>

<p>
"There in the yard, carrying a pail."
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!  I can see a bit of a black dot, that
is all."
</p>

<p>
She laughed with amusement.  "A black dot,"
she repeated.  "What's the matter with your eyes?"
</p>

<p>
He looked into her marvellous orbs with wonder and
admiration.  "I'm usually considered to have good
eyes," he said, "but they're not in it with yours.
You must be related to the golden eagle."
</p>

<p>
"I've seen a golden eagle's nest, and killed one too."
</p>

<p>
He pulled out his watch.  "By Jove!  I must get
back to the works, somebody will be stealing the
dynamos, or the coal," he added, looking at her with
a sudden smile.
</p>

<p>
She smiled too and they disappeared into the wood,
down the stony paths and across the bit of moorland.
He stopped at the gate of the works and held out
his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
He held her hand, looking into her eyes.  "You'll
come again to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered, steadily looking at him with
her wonderful eyes.
</p>

<p>
Still retaining his grip of her hand, he pulled her
gently towards him.
</p>

<p>
She came, somewhat reluctantly; the colour overspread
her face.  There was doubt in her eyes.  He
passed his disengaged arm round her neck and kissed
her on her full red lips.
</p>

<p>
A wild wonder sprang to her eyes.  "Gipsies don't
kiss," she said, as she gazed at him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't they?" he said, "then I'll do it again in
case you forget," and he did, a long kiss.  He looked
at her in astonished admiration, the deep colour that
mantled on her cheek, and the vivid light in her eyes
made a picture the like of which he had never seen.
</p>

<p>
She turned away and bounded off across the
moorland to her people's camp.  He watched her with
bright eyes, she turned and waved a hand to him then
disappeared among the caravans.  He went into the
little works very thoughtful for he knew that he was
violently in love with this beautiful girl&mdash;this child of
nature, and he seemed up against a blank wall.
</p>

<p>
He paced the little engine room slowly, chin on
breast, gazing unseeing at the tiles on the floor.  "I'll
tell her not to come again," he said to himself.  For
he was a very conscientious and a very ambitious
young man.
</p>

<p>
That was decided.  He threw back his shoulders
and raised his head with a feeling of relief.  Going
out into the boiler house, he opened the furnace doors,
and taking a fire rake in his hands, pushed back the
banked fires and spread them over the grates, he
sprinkled a few shovels full of coal over them, opened
the dampers, blew down the gauge glasses, and went
into his little office again to read.
</p>

<p>
Mostly he read technical works, but the book he
picked up now contained the life story of George
Stephenson.  There was a full page portrait in it too:
this fascinated the young engineer&mdash;he gazed at it
long and earnestly.  To him it seemed the face of the
greatest of all Englishmen, of all men; statesmen,
soldiers, philosophers, none of them had left such a
monument behind them, none had done so much for
civilization as this great man whose features he gazed
upon.  "And he was a fighter, too," he said to himself.
"Beat the prize fighter bully of his village, and
without training.  He must have been always fit and
lived very straight and clean."  He put down the
book and went outside.
</p>

<p>
The sun was now bright and powerful, but still low
down in the sky.  The young engineer gazed all
around at the fairy scene, enchanted with the beauty
of the landscape; yet he carried in his mind's eye
still the frontispiece of the book, a strong, sturdy
figure, and a firm, composed, yet kindly face.  The
picture seemed to haunt him.  "The ideal engineer,"
he said to himself, "would never get angry, only
think, think, deeper and deeper.  He would be
absolutely firm, but not a brute.  The engineer must
handle men as well as material, and this north country
collier did it!"  He felt his biceps.  "A great
engineer of to-day has laid it down that physical
fitness is the essential ground work of engineering
success."
</p>

<p>
"Why not me too?" he asked himself.
</p>

<p>
Next night the gipsy girl appeared earlier than usual,
he was not outside, and she ventured timidly in,
walking on tip-toe, her eyes glancing quickly all round
her.  She advanced to the foot of the switchboard
steps and stayed there.
</p>

<p>
He saw her then and went down to speak to her.
She held out her hand.  He took it gravely.  She
looked up at him underneath her long lashes, then her
eyes drooped, the colour mounted to her cheek, she
let her hand rest limply in his.  He looked at her
steadily for a minute, holding her hand, then he drew
her towards him and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
"You like kissing," he said.  She looked up at him
with all her soul in her wonderful dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;you," she said, simply.
</p>

<p>
"Go and sit down, I've got some work to do yet.
My coat's hanging up in the office there.  There's
some sweets in the pocket, take them out."
</p>

<p>
She went like an obedient child.
</p>

<p>
In ten minutes' time he went to her.  "We'll go
up on the hill again," he said, "and you shall tell me
what all the sounds and squeaks and all that we hear
in the wood mean."
</p>

<p>
So they started off, and at the edge of the wood a
dusky shape scampered off from the grass and
disappeared into the gloom.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Badger," she answered, promptly, in some surprise.
</p>

<p>
They commenced the ascent of the steep, stony path.
</p>

<p>
"Supposing I broke my leg, what would you do?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Carry you," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Think you could?"
</p>

<p>
She laughed, and going close up to him, put her
arms round him and lifted him easily.
</p>

<p>
"Well done," he said.
</p>

<p>
They went to the top and sat down again in the old
place, the little clearing, overlooking the valley.  They
sat for some time in silence.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you going to marry?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her sharply.  "Poor little devil,"
he thought, "is it possible&mdash;"  Then he looked into
her eyes very steadily, rather sadly.  "I haven't
any idea who I shall marry, yet," he said.  "Probably
some girl that I shall meet at home, some girl who
lives in a house about the same size that my father
lives in.  A girl who reads and writes, and perhaps
plays the piano and sings, who can look after a
house and manage servants and see that everything
is looked after properly.  That is," he added,
thoughtfully, "if I can ever make enough money to keep
such a girl."
</p>

<p>
She was silent, and he thought perhaps he had been
too brutal.
</p>

<p>
"I hope that she will be as beautiful and graceful as
you, but one can't have everything."
</p>

<p>
"What does your father do?" she asked, and her
tone was one of interested inquiry simply.
</p>

<p>
"He's a parson."
</p>

<p>
"Keeps a church?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly, or the church keeps him."
</p>

<p>
"I can play the fiddle and concertina and sing,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"Can you?" he asked, in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, father says I'm good."
</p>

<p>
"I've no doubt you are," he said, with some amusement.
He wondered what the gipsy standard of
music was.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he noticed her raise her head, listening
intently, he watched her with interest; the delicate
nostrils quivered, she seemed to be smelling something.
</p>

<p>
"There's someone in the wood," she said.
</p>

<p>
"All right.  Let 'em stop there."
</p>

<p>
"Come into the dark," she whispered.  She moved
silently into the shadow of the pine trees.
</p>

<p>
He was getting up to follow her when a rough
looking man in a round fur cap, a suit with big
poacher pockets to the coat and gaiters protecting
his trousers, and carrying a big stick under his arm,
came out into the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
"So I've caught you, have I?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"  The young engineer's
tone was angry, imperious.
</p>

<p>
"You knows, you an' that girl.  I seen her go
away."  Without more ado, he rushed viciously at
the engineer and lashed out a sweeping blow with his
bludgeon.
</p>

<p>
The young athlete sprang nimbly aside, and as the
gipsy turned to make a second onslaught, the girl
came out of the darkness of the wood behind and
sprang on his back like a wild cat, pulling him over
backwards and wrenching the stick from his grasp.
She threw it to the engineer.  "Take that," she said,
"and watch him."
</p>

<p>
The gipsy, cursing and spitting like an angry cat,
lashed out with his feet and caught the girl in the
ribs.
</p>

<p>
With a little sob, like a punctured balloon, she sank
down, a huddled, helpless heap.  The gipsy lashed
out again at her and then scrambled to his feet.
</p>

<p>
The engineer stood over him.  "You swine," he
said, and he brought the stick down over the man's
shoulders for all he was worth.  It was ash and very
stout; there was not much "give" in it.  He gave a
coughing gasp, then closed with his assailant.
</p>

<p>
They wrestled fiercely.  The gipsy was shorter and
not so heavy, but exceedingly strong; he strove to
work the engineer backwards towards the cliff, his
hands sought his throat.
</p>

<p>
The girl sat up.  "Mind the edge," she screamed.
"Throw him over."
</p>

<p>
<a id="p21"></a>
The engineer had dropped the stick, he passed his
forearm across the gipsy's throat and forced his head
backwards so that to save his neck or his back the man
had to relax his grip.  Instantly the engineer dealt
him a severe blow on the chin with his fist.
</p>

<p>
The gipsy staggered backwards.
</p>

<p>
The latent savagery of the chimpanzee and the
fierce deep passion of the sportsman who had been
"fouled" were aroused side by side in the breast of
the young engineer.  He sprang forward again and
struck the falling man another furious blow; he
seemed to yield easily; it was almost like striking the
empty air.  There was not that sense of springy
resistance which is the whole source of pleasure in a
blow well delivered and reaching well home.
</p>

<p>
With a sudden chilling of the blood he realized that
the man was over the edge, falling downwards on to
the trees.  He felt sick with horror and tried to throw
himself back, only to discover that the impetus of his
own forward progress was too much for him.  He
slowed up and hung for (it seemed to him) many
minutes just balanced, then gradually tilted forwards
towards the tops of the trees that showed down below
in the faint light of the rising dawn.  He seemed to be
moving very slowly&mdash;slowly, forwards.  He glanced
out over the valley below him and got a clear
impression of the view; he saw an owl flit past between
himself and the tree tops; he heard it hoot, its long
drawn, melancholy hoot.  Then he felt a sudden jerk
behind, something pulled him backwards, he felt his
centre of gravity shift till his legs had control of his
body again.  Then the blood rushed from his heart
with a mighty bound; he sank down on the soft bed
of the weather-browned pine needles.
</p>

<p>
"Good God!"
</p>

<p>
The girl leaned over him, her eyes alight.  "I
thought I was over too," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I thought that brute had killed you," he said.
</p>

<p>
She stretched herself and suddenly relaxed with a
little gasp.  "I'm all right.  I've got a pain, that's all."
</p>

<p>
The horror of the whole situation was suddenly
borne in upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Holy God!" he said.  "That's man killed."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" he said, "you mustn't say that.  If he
is, I'm a murderer."
</p>

<p>
"Then I hope he's not."
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"My sweetheart&mdash;the man I'm going to marry&mdash;if
he's alive," she answered, simply.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Great God in heaven!" he said, and he
held out his hands to the rising sun, gazing out on the
smiling valley and beautiful hills in the peaceful
stillness of the early dawn.

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p>
They wended their way slowly down the steep
path, the girl giving little gasps of pain at every
few steps.
</p>

<p>
"Look here!" he said, "you're damaged.  Let
me carry you."
</p>

<p>
"I'm all right.  I've got a pain, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Rot!" he said, and without more ado he picked
her up in his arms.  She was very light considering
the strength she had displayed.  "Say how you are
easiest," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Quite easy like this," she answered.
</p>

<p>
So they proceeded slowly down the stony, rocky
hillside, the girl cradled in his arms with her arms
round his neck easing her weight as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
He had to stop and rest frequently, laying her
gently on a bed of pine needles or moss.
</p>

<p>
"You're very strong," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, by God, too strong sometimes," he said,
bitterly.
</p>

<p>
She put her fingers gently on his wrist and felt his
pulse.  "You're a winner," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Meaning that I shall out distance the constable,"
he asked with a grim humour.
</p>

<p>
"What's your name?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Carstairs.  Jack Carstairs.  It'll be in all the
papers soon.  Can you read?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Lucky girl."
</p>

<p>
So carrying on a disjointed conversation they worked
their way round to the foot of the cliff.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I take you back to the camp or shall I have
a look for the&mdash;man, first?"
</p>

<p>
"We'll have a look for Sam first.  I'm all right on
level ground."
</p>

<p>
"No, you're not.  You stay there."  He put her
down on the ground, and made his way through the
trees to the cliff.
</p>

<p>
He searched up and down; there was no sign of a
body dead or alive, no sign of derangement, nothing
to indicate tragedy.  There was a rustle of bird life
all round him and a cheerful chorus of early morning
song in the bushes outside, for this was just on the
edge of the wood.  He went up and down gazing over
head and under foot; the trees here were mostly firs,
young spruce firs with heavy, carpety foliage
interlocking, shutting out the light.
</p>

<p>
He went back to the girl.  "I'll take you back and
go for a doctor while your people come and look for
him."
</p>

<p>
"He's gone home," she said.
</p>

<p>
That one word "home" is used to describe a vast
number of widely differing places.
</p>

<p>
"I hope to God he has&mdash;to the camp, I mean."
</p>

<p>
Picking her up in his arms again, he carried her out
across the strip of moorland to the camp.
</p>

<p>
The gipsies were out and astir, there seemed to be a
sort of meeting going on among the tents and caravans.
Jack Carstairs walked into the centre of them and
deposited his burden on the ground.
</p>

<p>
The girl sat up.  "There's Sam," she said, pointing
to a young gipsy sitting propped up against the
wheel of a caravan.  His face was deathly pale, and
one eye was bulged out like a small balloon.
</p>

<p>
The young engineer's heart gave a great bound at
the sight of him.
</p>

<p>
"So you were not killed," he said.
</p>

<p>
"'Taint no fault of yours," the man growled.  The
gipsies gathered round.
</p>

<p>
"Where's mother?" the girl asked.
</p>

<p>
A woman of about fifty, eagle-eyed, black-haired,
descended the steps of a particularly well-appointed
caravan and went over to the girl, and felt her
carefully all over.  "Who did it?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Sam kicked me," the girl answered.
</p>

<p>
The gipsies made no sound, but dark glistening
eyes rolled from the recumbent gipsy to the tall,
fair-haired young Englishman.
</p>

<p>
"Who's this?" the mother asked.
</p>

<p>
"The man at the electric light, that gave me the
coal."
</p>

<p>
The young man felt a pair of piercing black eyes
gazing searchingly into his, they seemed to see right
into his brain: he was aware of a strange tingling
sensation in his blood as the woman looked at him.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going to marry the girl?" she asked,
</p>

<p>
"No!" he said, simply.
</p>

<p>
The gipsies gathered in closer.
</p>

<p>
"Come here," the woman said.
</p>

<p>
He advanced and looked her squarely in the eyes.
</p>

<p>
She caught hold of his wrist, and lifting his hand
examined his palm.  She gazed at it long and
earnestly, ever and anon glancing up into his eyes.
She dropped it suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Alright!  Go away," she said.
</p>

<p>
The little circle of gipsy men fell back and opened
out for him to go his way.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with that man?" he asked,
pointing to Sam.
</p>

<p>
"Broke his leg," a gipsy man answered.
</p>

<p>
"What saved him?"
</p>

<p>
"The trees&mdash;he fell on the fir trees."
</p>

<p>
He put his hand in his pocket and pulled out all the
money he had, about seven shillings.  "Here, get
the girl whatever you can.  Shall I send a doctor?
</p>

<p>
"Doctor?" the woman repeated in scorn, "no!"
</p>

<p>
"Alright," he said, and made his way unmolested
past the silent, fierce-eyed men.
</p>

<p>
He went back to the little works and fired up the
boilers and got steam ready for the day man to start
the engine when he came in.
</p>

<p>
That night he went down about ten o'clock and
crossed over to the gipsies.  The whole camp was
gathered in a circle round the embers of a fire.
</p>

<p>
He stopped on the outside edge.  "How's the
girl?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Alright," the old woman answered.
</p>

<p>
"And the man?"
</p>

<p>
"Alright," she repeated.
</p>

<p>
He was turning to go away when she spoke again in
singularly sweet and winning tones.  "Won't you
come and sit down, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," he answered, stopping in doubt.
</p>

<p>
"And father'll play."
</p>

<p>
A young gipsy immediately got up and disappeared
into the flashy looking caravan, to reappear with a
violin and bow in his hands.
</p>

<p>
An old man who had lain stretched out before the
fire arose and took the instrument; he fingered it
lovingly.  Carstairs looked at him with curiosity;
he was attired in an old frock coat, green with age,
and the silk facings threadbare; straightened out he
would have been as tall as Carstairs himself, but he
was bent and bowed, his knees tottered, his face was
the uniform purple-red of the confirmed drunkard.
He tried the strings with his fingers, tuning up.  They
brought forward a chair, and he sat down.  The face,
Carstairs thought, showed something of refinement
and good breeding even in its bloated, blotched
condition.  He pushed back his greasy cap and showed
a head of fine silver-grey hair; the mouth was in
constant motion, twitching, compressing, relaxing.
He passed the bow across the strings, making a harsh,
jarring scream; then he seemed to settle down, and
Carstairs was entranced.
</p>

<p>
He dropped down beside one of the gipsies and sat
silent, lost in beautiful, entrancing thought.  All
that was best in his life came back to him, his highest
thoughts and loftiest ambition were stirred and
enlarged, his resolution strengthened, his soul uplifted.
He glanced round the circle of rough, mahogany-coloured
faces.  Dark eyes glistened like precious
jewels in the flickering firelight, the rough lines of the
features seemed softened.
</p>

<p>
And all this achieved by a tottering, degraded old
drunkard.
</p>

<p>
The player passed on from tune to tune, only pausing
to take a drink from a bottle that the old woman
handed him.  Many of the strains were familiar to
the young engineer; he understood they were "masterpieces"
difficult to render.  And wonder and a great
pity stirred in him side by side at the awful contrast,
the inexpressible beauty of the music and the despicable
condition of the player.  But he, too, seemed to
straighten out and grow taller; he stood up, the
mouth became steadier, the bleared eyes seemed
quite brilliant in the dim light.
</p>

<p>
Slowly dying down, growing gradually less, the
music stopped.  Then dropping bow and fiddle the
musician made straight for the brass-finished,
leather-upholstered caravan, and disappeared inside.
</p>

<p>
There was silence round the little circle of the
gipsies, no one stirred; Carstairs was lost in reverie,
ideas thronged through his brain; he was lost to the
present, his soul seemed free of his body, delving
about in the unknown depths of the future.
</p>

<p>
A young gipsy started up from the circle and picked
up the fiddle and bow.  For Carstairs that broke the
spell, he looked up and found the gipsy woman's eyes
upon him.
</p>

<p>
He arose and went over to her.  "What lovely
music," he said.  "Who is he?"
</p>

<p>
"My husband," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" he said.  He held out his hand.  "Good-bye! you
must thank him very much for me."
</p>

<p>
She took his hand and looked into his eyes in the
fixed firelight.  "You like music?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Very much," he answered.
</p>

<p>
He felt a strange feeling of friendliness for this
woman, her presence seemed to give him a sensation
of comfort, of hope.
</p>

<p>
Wending his way out of the gipsy camp he crossed to
the little works.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry I'm late."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's alright."
</p>

<p>
They passed the technical news of the day, then
the bearded Scotsman and the other young engineer
departed.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stood at the door watching them go away
along the winding path beside the river, towards the
little town.  He hadn't altogether shaken off the
reverie induced by the music; he gazed out into the
silence of the night; in the beautiful half light of the
northern night, he could see far up the valley.  Long
after his companions had disappeared from view he
stood there gazing out over the silent landscape, and
for once his thoughts were not entirely of himself, of
his ambitions and resolves: he wondered at the old
man who played the beautiful music, the old woman
and the girl, their offspring; it seemed incredible, the
girl was so different from either of them.  He went
inside, closing the wicket gate in the big doors behind
him, then going into the little office he produced a
drawing-board and instruments and settled down
resolutely to work; for he had ideas, many of them,
and his occupation gave him ample time for thought.
</p>

<p>
Next night he went down early to call at the camp
again, but when he got there, he found, with a
disappointment he was astonished at, the gipsies were
gone.
</p>

<p>
"Cancelled out," he said to himself, for Carstairs
thought mathematically.  Still, as he spoke, he felt
a doubt if the factor were really eliminated.
</p>

<p>
So time, relentless time, passed away, and Carstairs
went his daily round, working and studying, planning
and dreaming.  Very often in the early summer
mornings when he had been on all night, and found it
impossible to study any more, he would take his pistol
and wander out along the river bank looking for rats
or water voles.  Always the vision of the gipsy girl
came back to him.  Her verdict "you're a winner,"
occurred to him as he fired at the rats or selected some
inanimate mark to aim at, and always hit, for his hand
was strong and steady and his eye very keen.  One
day as he wandered so, pistol in hand, there was a
sudden swirl in the water, a gleam of silver shot
heavenwards, he pointed the pistol and pulled just
as the salmon touched the water again, it dived
instantly, but there was something wrong with it,
the white belly seemed unduly prominent, it was
obviously impeded by something.
</p>

<p>
"Hit! by Jove!" Carstairs said, as the big fish
came to the surface and lay quite still floating
down with the stream.  "A winner," he said, and
he wondered thoughtfully if it would always be so.
</p>

<p>
Then he went on holiday, ten days, back to his
home in Gloucestershire, the country vicarage and
the Cotswold hills, where the pick of the old prize
fighters came from; and there was much of the prize
fighter in Carstairs' composition, perhaps it was in the
air.
</p>

<p>
The Reverend Hugh Carstairs was tall and well
built, silver haired and clean shaven; his religion was
of the comfortable order; he did not consider it
necessary to be miserable in order to be good.  He
was clean in mind and body, rather sporting and
rather intellectual.  His good lady was somewhat
similar, less sporting and less intellectual, more homely
and more pious.  The product of the union was six
well-grown, healthy Englishmen.  Jack was the
youngest.
</p>

<p>
His parents received him with undemonstrative but
deep-felt pleasure.  Up to the present Jack had been,
if not the most prosperous, the least expensive of the
six; engineering to him had been more or less
compulsory because cheap, or comparatively so.  The
other five had absorbed large sums in their education,
and up to the present made small return on capital
invested.  Jack didn't gamble or drink expensive
drinks; he didn't paint pictures or play any musical
instrument.  As far as his parents knew he had had
no love affairs.  He was a very sober young man.  His
mother said he feared God.  His father, that he
respected himself.  The truth was that he had an
ambition to bulk very big at some future date, and
so had not the time for indulgence in the ordinary
common or garden vices and pastimes.
</p>

<p>
He kissed his mother and shook hands solemnly
with his father.
</p>

<p>
"I want to take some of your books away with me
when I go, guv'nor," he said.
</p>

<p>
His parents looked at him with approval.  "What
sort of books?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! 'maths.'  I find I don't know as much
mathematics as I thought I did."
</p>

<p>
His mother looked somewhat disappointed, his
father pleased.  The dividends on classics did not pan
out very well in his experience.
</p>

<p>
"I'm working out an idea, you know; rather good
thing if it's workable.  Want some more 'maths,'
to read up the authorities on the subject."
</p>

<p>
"A patent?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Ah," his mother sighed, something seemed to
touch a sensitive chord.  "You know Phillip is going
out to India?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Plantation, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, in a very nice part of the country, I believe."
</p>

<p>
"What's he going to get?"
</p>

<p>
"Twenty pounds a month," his father answered.
</p>

<p>
"That isn't much for a man twenty-four years old,
is it?  Fitters get that out there."
</p>

<p>
"My dear boy!"  His mother was grieved.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, mater?"
</p>

<p>
"You have such a sordid way of looking at things."
</p>

<p>
"Have I?  I'm sorry.  The aim and object of
life at present is to make money."
</p>

<p>
The Rev. Hugh regarded his son with quiet
approval.  "It keeps you occupied," he said, "and
as long as you're honest."
</p>

<p>
Jack was silent.  "As a general rule I am," he
said, at length.  "Stole a basketful of coal the other
day, though."
</p>

<p>
"Coal?  Whatever for?"
</p>

<p>
"Gave it away to the poor."  He waved his arm
lightly with a smile.
</p>

<p>
His father smiled too, he had Jack's eyes, grey and
shrewd.  "To a certain extent the end justified the
means," he said, "That is, in the common court of
our conscience.  I suppose it was very cold up in
Scotland?"
</p>

<p>
"On that particular day it was, I think, if anything
warmer than it is down here to-day.  I should
like to be whitewashed, but&mdash;the end was a very
pretty gipsy girl, whom I afterwards kissed, and
punched her affianced husband&mdash;broke his leg."
</p>

<p>
"Good gracious! you're joking."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit, mater.  I'm going to shine as the
villain of the family; it's in me, for under the given
circumstance, I'd do the same again."  He gave them
the main outlines of the case, concisely, hiding nothing.
</p>

<p>
"I think you'd better leave Scotland," his mother
said.
</p>

<p>
"So do I, mater," he agreed.  "I want more money."
</p>

<p>
The Rev. Hugh's grey eyes twinkled merrily.
"Everything comes to him who goes and fetches
it," he said.
</p>

<p>
"That's an engineering precept, guv'nor.  An
engineer is a man who fetches things.  You ought to
have been an engineer, not a bally old parson."
</p>

<p>
"Jack!"
</p>

<p>
"Sorry, mater, that's a <i>lapsus fungus</i>, or words to
that effect."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Lapsus linguæ</i>, you mean."
</p>

<p>
"Is it?  Oh! fungus seemed to me rather
suggestive of the tongue."
</p>

<p>
Jack was standing up with his back to the mantel-piece.
His father smiled, then he stood up, too, and,
laying a hand on his son's broad shoulder, looked with
solemn, benevolent eyes into the eyes that were level
with, and so like, his own.  "Go on fetching things,
my boy, but never forget that the object of life is
happiness.  And happiness is only possible to an
easy conscience.  It is nice to win the match, but
better to lose than cheat.  I should leave these gipsy
girls alone, if I were you."
</p>

<p>
"Singular, if you please, guv'nor, it's only one, and
she's gone away."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so.  I was generalizing."
</p>

<p>
Jack was thoughtful.  "Up to the present," he
said, "it is not necessary to generalize, but thanks
all the same."
</p>

<p>
The Rev. Hugh looked at his son, at the steady eyes
and close, firm mouth; the lines were very definite,
almost cruel; such men do not have many love affairs.
"I think you can take care of yourself," he said.
</p>

<p>
Jack was perfectly sober.  "I think so, too," he
agreed.

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p>
The vicarage at Chilcombe, Jack's home, was a
fairly large, well-built house with plenty of
ground round it, forming a complete rectangle.  Two
sides of it (bordering the road) were bounded by seven-foot
walls, a third side was a thick, tall hedge, and the
fourth (furthest from the house) was a brook, or river&mdash;a
sort of cross, a big brook or a small river&mdash;deeply
bordered with willow trees and blackberry bushes.
Two close wooden gates in the seven-foot wall opened
on to a small brown-gravel drive, which led by a single
short curve through a shrubbery of laurel bushes to the
front entrance porch.  A big room at the other side
of the house opened out by French windows on to
a lawn.  There was a big chestnut tree in one corner
of this lawn, with a seat round it; in the summer
there were usually two or three hammock chairs spread
out in the shade of it also.  Jack was lounging in one
of these latter the morning after his arrival, while his
mother did knitting in a more sedate-looking but less
comfortable chair at his side, when Mrs Bevengton
and Bessie came round the corner of the house.  Mrs
Bevengton was the doctor's wife, and Bessie was her
daughter.  Bessie was fairly tall and distinctly
plump&mdash;"fatty" Jack used to call her when he was
younger; she was not really fat, though not angularly
hard; there was no superfluous tissue about her.  She
could play tennis all day long, run with the beagles,
or row two or three miles on the river without getting
"done up."  She had a good pink colour and dimples
on each cheek which were nearly always in evidence,
for she smiled at most things.  Her hair was light
brown and curly; it was always straying out of place
and framing her happy, smiling face in little light
brown curves.
</p>

<p>
Bessie said, "How are you Jack?" and Jack
answered, "First-class.  How are you?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs Bevengton looked at him critically.  "What
are you doing now, Jack?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Earning ten bob a week, Mrs Bevengton," he
answered, with just a flicker of a smile.  The doctor's
wife was inclined to be a materialist in worldly matters.
</p>

<p>
Bessie's dimples burst into renewed prominence,
and a frizzy curl strayed out from over her forehead.
She said nothing, but her blue eyes danced in the
sunlight as she glanced round the three faces in front of
her, and endeavoured to suppress the rebellious curl.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Carstairs looked severe.  "How absurdly you
talk, Jack."
</p>

<p>
"The truth is usually absurd, mater."
</p>

<p>
Mrs Bevengton continued to regard him with a
critical, calculating eye.
</p>

<p>
"That's just a start, of course?" she said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope it's not the finish, Mrs Bevengton."
</p>

<p>
Mrs Bevengton looked at Bessie, then back again
at Jack.  He seemed very steady-looking and
confident; she had only a vague notion of what he was
doing, but had an impression that electrical engineering
was a safe sort of thing, displacing the Church as
the thing to put the fool of the family into.  Still,
the Carstairs so far had not "got on."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it's a good er&mdash;profession, isn't it, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
Jack looked at his hands which would have compared
favourably with a young carpenter's.  "Fairly
good, I think," he said, "for the right men.  About
the same as doctoring, only more pleasant&mdash;to the
young mind at least."
</p>

<p>
Mrs Carstairs smiled approval.
</p>

<p>
The doctor's wife was puzzled.  He spoke too
soberly for a Carstairs&mdash;and nineteen.  She looked
at Mrs Carstairs.  "When does Phillip leave?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not for six weeks yet."
</p>

<p>
Jack looked at Bessie.  "Come on, Bessie!  I'll
give you a game of tennis.  Expect you'll beat me
easily now.  Haven't had a game since last summer."
</p>

<p>
"Don't they play in Scotland?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, they play, but I don't."
</p>

<p>
So they played, and it was very close, but Bessie
did not win.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you've been practising," she said.
</p>

<p>
"No, I haven't," he answered.  "Come on down
to the brook and see if that old trout is still there."
</p>

<p>
"That old trout," was an ancient retainer of the
Carstairs family, weighing some two to two and a half
pounds.  Six successive sons had tried to catch him:
bright red worms, "dopping" blue bottles, artificial
flies, gentles and green caterpillars had been tried in
vain; the veteran shook his head and slowly winked
the other eye as he lazily flapped his tail in the gentle
current, regarding the tempting baits and eager faces
peering over the blackberry bushes with easy
unconcern.  Twice they had waded through the shallows,
three abreast, with butterfly nets, after frightening
him from his deep hole, but without success: once,
indeed, with the aid of wire netting, was the speckled
warrior landed, high and dry; but after performing a
joyous war-dance, hand in hand, round the panting,
kicking champion, the means were voted underhand
and mean&mdash;not sporting&mdash;so by unanimous
consent he was consigned to the deep again, never
afterwards, by fair means or foul, to be lured thence.
In later days he reigned supreme, monarch of all he
surveyed, for many yards on either side of the willow
tree, his seat.  It was considered the correct thing,
when on holidays, to feed him with worms and
gentles and other tit-bits.
</p>

<p>
So, rackets in hands, they strolled down to the brook
and peeped cautiously over the top of a blackberry
bush, down into a deep hole under the roots of an
overhanging willow tree; silently they pressed
forward, for the bush had grown and obscured the view
more than it used to.  Suddenly there was a slip,
a little scream, a sound of tearing dress material, a
splash, and Bessie was in the stream.
</p>

<p>
Jack knew that Bessie could not swim, one of the
few athletic accomplishments she had not acquired.
The water was six or seven feet deep for two or three
hundred yards on either side of the hole, which
was nine or ten feet deep, the banks were very
steep.
</p>

<p>
Without a second's pause, Jack burst his way
through the bushes and into the stream; the brambles
clung to him and let him down gently.  He found
Bessie floundering hopelessly, head under water, one
leg elevated in the air, held securely by a tangle of
brambles, so keeping her in an inverted position.
</p>

<p>
He grabbed an overhanging branch of the willow
tree with one hand and reached down for Bessie's hair
with the other.  He succeeded in raising her head
above water.  She clutched his arm frantically,
half-unconscious, she had quite lost her reason.
</p>

<p>
"Steady!  Steady!" he said, soothingly.  "Kick
your leg free."
</p>

<p>
She was unable to comprehend, so he gave a vigorous
tug at her; the brambles yielded pliantly, but did not
let go.
</p>

<p>
"Damn the thing," he said.  He tugged again, and
the fresh green willow branch broke off short at the
rotten old trunk.  Bessie's head sank under water
again, and she clutched him in a despairing grasp;
he "trod water" vigorously and tried to pull her clear
of the bramble; then he tried to get free of her grasp so
that he might get at the bramble at close quarters,
but she clung to him in despairing energy, and she was
very strong.  Twice he lifted her head out of water
and let her get a breath, but the effort drove him very
deep down himself, and he was beginning to feel the
strain.
</p>

<p>
He looked round him in search of inspiration.  The
water was running very placidly and calmly past him,
all dappled with round spots of sunlight coming
through the leaves of the trees.  A little way off, his
mother and Bessie's mother sat quietly chatting in the
shade of the chestnut tree, a cow grazed peacefully
very near the opposite bank; he could hear the steady
"munch" of her jaws; a willow wren trilled out a
pretty little warble on a tree near by; and Bessie
was drowning.  Jack wondered what to do.  It never
occurred to him to shout for help, he never shouted for
help&mdash;he was not built that way.
</p>

<p>
"Her grip will relax when she gets unconscious,"
he said to himself, and thinking so, he pulled her head
deeper under water and tugged to get free of her grip.
This time he succeeded, and instantly hauled himself
up the bank by means of the entangled leg and set it
free.  It was very simple; two interlaced briars
formed a stirrup, that was all.  He raised the foot
and it was free at once.  Then he dropped back into
the water and getting under her, raised her head, and
swam with her down stream where the bank shelved
down; getting out and laying her on the grass, he
applied his rudimentary knowledge of artificial
resuscitation; he saw a gentle heaving of the breast,
then picked her up and hurried towards the
house.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Bevengton saw him coming and ran to meet him.
</p>

<p>
"Whatever is the matter?" she said.  She was
very pale, but not hysterical.  Jack noted her
behaviour with approval.
</p>

<p>
"Bessie fell into the brook, got her head fixed under
water for some time; she's breathing alright."  He
hurried on into the house with her.
</p>

<p>
The doctor was immediately sent for while Mrs
Bevengton administered all she knew, and in half an
hour Bessie was sitting up in bed, Jack's bed, drinking
hot beef tea.  She smiled genially.  "I'm sorry to give
you all this trouble, Mrs Carstairs," she said.
</p>

<p>
That evening Jack's sailor uncle paid a surprise
visit&mdash;his were nearly always surprise visits; he came
and went like the sea breeze, fresh, boisterous, and
invigorating.  As they sat smoking after dinner and
commenting on the morning's catastrophe, Commander
John Carstairs, R.N., looked across at his nephew and
namesake through the smoke.
</p>

<p>
"You didn't shout?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"It didn't occur to me."
</p>

<p>
"Like to bully through on your own, eh?
</p>

<p>
"That's it, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to have put that boy in the service, Hugh."
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;yes, perhaps so."
</p>

<p>
"How would you have liked it, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, first-class, I think.  However 'what is, is
best,' you know, 'the moving finger writes,' etc.
I'm going to make money."
</p>

<p>
The sailor's merry blue eyes became thoughtful,
and so, even the casual observer must have been
struck by the sense of power the whole man conveyed.
The face was clean shaven and of an even pink-red all
over, the jaw very strong and square, the cheek bones
high and the nose prominent, the mouth a straight
line, the eyes deep set and not too close together as
deep-set eyes usually are; in repose they looked stern
and hard, when he smiled they were the most kindly
looking in all the world; his figure, particularly the
shoulders and chest, gave one the impression that he
swung heavy-weight Indian clubs for many hours each
day.
</p>

<p>
"The service makes men, but not millionaires," he
remarked, and his own personality seemed the proof
of the assertion.
</p>

<p>
The Rev. Hugh chimed in.  "It's better to be a
man than a millionaire."
</p>

<p>
The sailor smiled again.  "Nature has done that
for Jack," he said.
</p>

<p>
Dr Bevengton (who stayed to dinner) broke in.
"It's possible to be both, I imagine."
</p>

<p>
Jack Carstairs puffed slowly at one of his father's
cigars.  "The line of demarcation between a man
and a fool is rather hard to draw, I think."
</p>

<p>
The sailor laughed uproariously.
</p>

<p>
The parson's eyes twinkled merrily.
</p>

<p>
Dr Bevengton seemed more surprised than amused.
"How?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've heard both a man and a fool defined in
so very many different ways.  One of our Scotch
labourers assured me that a man who couldn't take
a half tumbler of whisky neat was 'nae man at a'.'
Then one frequently hears such terms as 'an ass who
plays football,' or 'a fool who reads Shakespeare.'"
</p>

<p>
The three older men regarded the solemn-faced
youngster with much amusement.
</p>

<p>
"What do you propose to do about it then, Jack?"
the sailor asked.
</p>

<p>
"Please myself," Jack answered.
</p>

<p>
The sailor slapped his knee.  "Well done!" he
said.  "By Jove, that's good!  What about the
girl?" he asked, suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"What girl?"
</p>

<p>
Commander Carstairs looked towards the ceiling.
"Upstairs," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she'll be alright, thanks," the doctor answered.
</p>

<p>
"Be about again soon, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes.  To-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Then you'll have a chance before you go back,
Jack, to prove yourself a man or a fool."
</p>

<p>
The sailor smiled genially at his nephew, and his
nephew regarded him in solemn silence.  The doctor
coughed, so did the parson.
</p>

<p>
The sea develops to a remarkable degree the English
trait of persistence.  Nothing short of a twelve-inch
shell would have diverted Jack's uncle from his
"chaff."
</p>

<p>
"In these cases, Jack, there's nothing like striking
when the iron's hot," he continued.
</p>

<p>
The doctor and the parson were distinctly ill at
ease, the sailor was happy, the young engineer quite
calm.  He puffed away slowly at his cigar while the
sailor looked laughingly into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I perceive, uncle," Jack said, at length, "that it's
possible to be a fool and a man at the same time."
</p>

<p>
All three men burst into a hearty laugh, the sailor
leading.
</p>

<p>
Next day Bessie was about again, and Jack met her
on the lawn.  Her dimples were as deep as ever and
her hair as rebellious.  She held out her hand,
"Thanks very much for pulling me out, Jack,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! it's alright," he answered.
</p>

<p>
God, in His wisdom, has denied speech to the
English, but has specially endowed them with feeling.
</p>

<p>
They played tennis again and went down and looked
at the place where she fell in.
</p>

<p>
"Did you have a job to get me out?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, fair!" he answered.
</p>

<p>
So time passed away and the ten days were soon
gone.  Jack visited all his old haunts and friends and
saw a good deal of Bessie.  Their relations were
changing, they were merging into man and woman, the
incident of the brook seemed to have hastened it.
Jack saw a difference in her; she seemed a trifle shy
at times, and he never failed to notice it.  He noticed,
too, that she seemed to defer to him more, and not
dispute, as they always used to.  When he was going
away, he said good-bye to her alone, and as he shook
hands he noticed a look in her eyes that surprised him.
She blushed slightly.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry I'm going back," he said.
</p>

<p>
"So am I," she answered.  She seemed distinctly sad.
</p>

<p>
One evening, before his uncle had left, they had all
spent the evening with the doctor.  As the men sat
alone smoking, his uncle had questioned Jack about
his work.  Jack remembered that the doctor had
listened with marked interest.
</p>

<p>
"They call me an Improver," Jack had explained.
"Certainly, I've improved lots of things since I've
been there, and wrecked others.  'Improver wanted
for Central Station in Scotland, must have workshop
training and theoretical knowledge, good opportunity
to gain a thorough insight into Central Station work.
Salary (they called it salary) ten shillings per
week.'  That's how the advertisement ran.  They are correct
in describing the insight to be gained as 'thorough.'  My
first job was to sweep out the engine room and to
do it thoroughly, then I had to clean the switchboard,
thoroughly too, then, as I had shown my ability, I
was allowed to wipe down the engine, thoroughly.
Now I stoke boilers and drive engines and operate the
switchboard&mdash;all for the same pay, while the latest
comer sweeps the floor, etc."
</p>

<p>
The doctor, Jack had noticed, looked considerably
down in the mouth.  The sailor only laughed.
"That'll do you good," he had said.
</p>

<p>
All these things Jack thought over after he had left
Bessie, and the train was speeding him northward.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
Back in Scotland, Jack Carstairs took up the
thread of his work where he had left off, stepped
into the old routine again.  He had "started applying,"
that is to say he carefully scanned the advertisement
columns of the <i>Electrical Review</i>, and then
in dignified and appropriate language submitted a list
of his qualifications to those people (and at this time
their name was legion) who required the services of
junior station engineers.  Nearly all of these were
municipalities, and they set out gaudy, lengthily
worded advertisements occupying about a quarter
of a column, with elaborate specification of duties
and qualifications.  They finished up with the mild
and modest statement that the salary (?) would be
at the rate of one pound (or perhaps twenty-five
shillings) per week.
</p>

<p>
Jack answered dozens of these; sometimes he
received a little printed slip to inform him that his
application had not been successful, which usually
arrived by the time he had forgotten all about it, or
else he heard nothing whatever.  He usually wrote
out these applications at the works and posted them
on his way home.  His route, via the post-box, lay
along a road deeply shaded with big beech trees on
one side and an open space on the other, the footpath
ran along under the trees.
</p>

<p>
One night, coming off duty at midnight, as he
pursued his usual way home, enjoying the deep peace
of the night, carrying a bundle of letters in his hands,
he felt a sudden, violent blow on the back of the head,
and the next thing he knew was that he woke up with
a violent headache, and found himself lying on his
back, under the shade of one of the big trees.  He put
his hand to the back of his head and felt a big lump
there.  He staggered to his feet and searched his
pockets; everything was intact, nothing gone or
displaced; his letters were lying scattered on the
ground; painfully and slowly he gathered them up,
the stooping made his head seem about to burst.
Then he staggered home to his diggings, posting his
letters on the way, and wondering with the vague and
painful persistence of the fevered brain who or what
had struck him and why.
</p>

<p>
He let himself into his diggings, and going to his
bedroom, carefully sponged his head with water.
Then he wiped it dry, sat down and ate his supper,
and went to bed.
</p>

<p>
His sleep was somewhat fevered and disturbed, but
he woke up in the morning feeling only a bad headache.
</p>

<p>
"Damn funny thing," he said to himself, then he
turned over and went to sleep again.  His landlady
knocked at his door and told him it was very late, so
he got up and felt fairly fresh.
</p>

<p>
"You're looking pale, Mr Carstairs," his landlady
remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm feeling a bit pale," he answered.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him searchingly.  Scottish women
have an equal curiosity with other women but less
tongue; she said nothing, and he volunteered no
further information, partly because he was naturally
uncommunicative, and partly&mdash;well, he could not say
why exactly, but he did not.
</p>

<p>
There are so many things which one does not quite
know why one does, which afterwards prove of vast
consequence, which is probably why most men who
observe and think are superstitious, religious, or
fatalistic.  The man who can only read plain print
does not believe in these things.
</p>

<p>
Jack Carstairs said nothing, but he went down to
the works as usual, and they remarked there that he
looked pale and had a lump on the back of his head.
</p>

<p>
"What's up?" the vociferous young English
engineer asked (it is astonishing what a number of
English electrical engineers there are in Scotland).
</p>

<p>
"The sky," Jack answered, laconically.
</p>

<p>
"Alright!  Go to the devil!" the other man
answered, and went away.
</p>

<p>
The bearded, blue-eyed Scotsman looked at him
in solemn seeing silence; he said nothing, and his gaze
was not obtrusive.  The Scotch are a pleasant people
to live with because they have grasped, above all
others, the art of minding their own business, which
possibly also explains why Scotsmen occupy high
places all over the world.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs went back the same way that night again,
but he took a handy piece of light, strong iron piping
with him.  He walked clear of the trees and looked
carefully all around, but saw no one.
</p>

<p>
He walked on and had just reached his diggings
when he heard a light step behind him; he turned
and saw a tall girl quite close to him.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, sir," she said.  It was the gipsy
girl.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs face brightened with pleasure and surprise.
"What are you doing here?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes seemed to glow as she looked into his.
"Following you," she answered.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he noticed she carried a substantial ash
cudgel.  A great wave of wonder passed over him.
"Good God, was it you who flattened me out last
night?
</p>

<p>
"No, that was Sam."
</p>

<p>
His face relaxed with a look of relief.  "Were you
there, then?"
</p>

<p>
There was an involuntary twitch of the cudgel in
her hand.  "He wouldn't have done it if I'd been
there."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs' look showed admiration and appreciation.
"That's jolly good of you," he said.  "Where are
you&mdash;er&mdash;where is the camp?"
</p>

<p>
She mentioned a place twenty miles away.
</p>

<p>
He raised his eyebrows in surprise.  "How did you
get here, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Walked," she answered, simply.
</p>

<p>
"How'll you get back?"
</p>

<p>
"Walk," she said, again.
</p>

<p>
"But you can't walk all night&mdash;all that distance."  He
glanced helplessly up at the window of his little
sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
She followed his glance.  "I'll have a sleep out in
the fields before I start," she said.  She stepped up
closer and looked into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Sam's going to 'do' for you."  She watched him
intently.  The grey eyes hardened down till they
glinted like steel in the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
"That's very kind of him," he said.
</p>

<p>
"But he won't do it," she added.  "You'll do for him."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps," he admitted, slowly.  "I rather hope
not.  Are you&mdash;er&mdash;married yet?"
</p>

<p>
"No!  Not going to be."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"
</p>

<p>
"Mother said I needn't, and I don't want to.  I'm
going to work in a house, a farm," she watched him
closely, "not far from here."
</p>

<p>
With a spontaneous movement he held out his
hand.  "Good, then I may see you sometimes.
Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
She held up her face expectantly and he kissed her
on the lips.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye again.  You're quite alright now?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Dash it!  Drop the sir.  Can I bring you out
some food?"
</p>

<p>
"No, thank you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, good-bye.  Come over and look me up at
the works when you've time, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered.  She turned and went away.
He stood looking after her as she went away down the
long moonlit street.  He stood at the mouth of the
"close" (the common entrance to a number of flats),
his latchkey at his lips, whistling softly, in doubt.
Suddenly he started off at a run after her.  She
turned quickly, grasping her cudgel, at the sound of
his footsteps.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, I'll let you into my digs, my rooms,
you know, and you can stay there till the morning.
I'll stroll around."
</p>

<p>
"No!" she answered, not aggressively, but quite
decisively.
</p>

<p>
"Alright!  I'll stay out with you then, till it's
light."
</p>

<p>
She laughed in real amusement.  "I'm going to
sleep," she answered.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her and saw she meant it; doubt again
assailed him.  "I suppose you're used to it?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
She laughed aloud.  "I've never slept in a bed,"
she answered.
</p>

<p>
He laughed too.  "I've never slept out of one," he
said, "good-bye."  He went back again and let
himself into his diggings, and went to bed.
</p>

<p>
Next morning there were two letters waiting for
him, both with the city arms of a municipality
embossed on the flap of the envelope.  "The mayor
and corporation, or the City Electrical Engineer
regret," he said to himself with a smile as he opened
them.  In the first, the city electrical engineer of a
municipality in the north of England had to inform
him that his application for the post of switchboard
attendant at a salary of one pound per week had been
successful, and would be pleased to know the earliest
date on which he could take up his duties.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs read over the short, concisely worded
document a second time.  With a little thrill of
pleasure he repeated the name of the town to himself.
"That's a big job," he said, "and likely to grow."  He
opened the other letter.  Another Borough
Electrical Engineer in the Midlands had pleasure in
offering him an appointment as switchboard attendant
at a salary of one pound per week, and desired that he
start as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
He smiled over his lonely breakfast table, at the
soup plateful of porridge, at the fried bacon and eggs,
at the brown bread and the coffee-pot.  It was the
sort of smile one must share with somebody or something,
or burst; for Jack Carstairs was nineteen.  He
ate his breakfast with much zest, but before it was
over he got up and fished out directories and lists of
Central Stations from a pile of books and papers in a
cupboard; with these spread out on the table before
him, or propped up against the sugar basin, he took
intermittent mouthfuls of food while he carefully
scanned the lists.  Then having found both the towns
and noted the capacity and peculiarity of their plant,
the population, etc., he gave his whole attention to his
plate, thinking deeply as he ate.  "Not much to
choose between them," he said to himself.
</p>

<p>
Then he went out for a walk and walked along,
deep in thought.  "I think," he said to himself, at
the end of his stroll, "I think Muddleton (the town
in the Midlands) will be the better experience."
</p>

<p>
He went down to the works to see his chief and find
out if he could get away earlier than his legal
agreement allowed him to.  Then he went back to his digs
and wrote accepting one and refusing the other.
</p>

<p>
In after life he often wondered what would have
happened had he chosen the other.  This seeming
free choice, is it really free, and if so, how far?
</p>

<p>
Next day he hired a bicycle (he did not own one,
could not afford the time to use it and look after it,
he said) and cycled over to the place where the gipsy
girl had told him their camp was pitched.  He tried
every road that led out of the little Scotch village, but
could find nothing of the camp.  He made inquiries,
and the dour highland policeman looked at him with
open suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"Gipsy camp," he repeated, "na, there's nae gipsy
camp around here."
</p>

<p>
So Carstairs went back the way he had come, and
in a week was in the train for England.  He was
hurried out of Scotland, over the moorlands and
southwards through the wilderness of little towns
that cluster, thick as blackberries (and about the
same hue), all about the heart of England.  At four
o'clock in the morning, he was turned out, bag and
baggage, in a great industrial centre, on the middle
platform of a vast and gloomy station.  By eight
o'clock a.m. he had reached his destination.
</p>

<p>
He got out at the dirty little station with somewhat
of the edge taken off his enthusiasm.  Leaving his
luggage in the cloak-room, he went out and wandered
round the town, looking at the smoke stacks and the
factories, the squalor and the dirt.
</p>

<p>
He located the works in the lowest and dirtiest part
of the town, and next to the gas-works, as usual.  The
extent of the buildings and the two towering chimney
stacks acted like a tonic on his somewhat jaded
spirits.  At ten o'clock he went round again and
interviewed his new chief, a tall clean-shaven young
man of twenty-six, who drew a modest salary of £400
per annum; he was very affable and pleasant, but not
in the least impressed by the gravity of the situation.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes! you're the new switchboard attendant.
Have you had a look round?  No?  Oh, go out and
stroll round the works, then.  Mr Thomson will be in
shortly."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs went out into the engine room and
wandered in and out amongst the big engines, till
another very young man, in his shirt sleeves, came
up and asked him what he wanted.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs explained.
</p>

<p>
The young man smiled a pleasant smile, and held
out his hand.  "I'm the Shift Engineer.  My name
is Smith.  Come on upstairs."  He took Carstairs up
the switchboard steps, along the gallery, and into a
big room at the end.  It was very light, with large
windows and glass doors, and numerous lights, all
burning.  Five other young men, very young (the
eldest of them not over twenty-two), were lounging
around on tables and chairs.  All had their coats off,
and some their collars as well.  One had a piece of
flexible wood with a large piece of cardboard fastened
across the end; with this instrument he gravely
hunted flies, squashing them flat on walls or window
panes, remarking "exit," in a mechanical sort of
voice at every stroke.  A long sloping-topped drawing
table occupied the whole length of the room under
the windows, another large drawing board was supported
on light trestles in another part, an ordinary
writing table occupied the centre.  Instruments,
paper, pencils, ink, technical journals, and pocket
books, were scattered about broadcast.
</p>

<p>
Seated on the table in the middle, idly swinging his
legs, a young man was telling a story; all the others,
except the fly hunter, listened attentively.  He was
tall and dark, with a small neat moustache and
marvellous large brown eyes.
</p>

<p>
The Shift Engineer introduced them.  "Darwen,
this is Carstairs, the new switchboard attendant."
</p>

<p>
The dark young man reached out a hand&mdash;a strong,
sinewy hand, with long, taper, artistic fingers; he
smiled, such a genial, winning smile, that Carstairs
felt friendly towards him at once.
</p>

<p>
The Shift Engineer continued the introduction with
a light wave of the arm.  "Green, Brown, Jones,
Robinson."  Then he perched himself on the table.
"Go on with the yarn, Darwen," he said.
</p>

<p>
The dark man smiled, and Carstairs noted the
remarkable perfection of his face; the forehead was
broad and not too high; the nose strong but delicately
chiselled; the chin, well moulded and firm
but not aggressively prominent; the mouth was
almost perfect.  The whole man presented a striking
picture: the head was perfectly shaped, and the
figure gave every indication of great strength and
activity; the deltoid muscles at the angle of the
shoulder showed very prominently, the neck was big
and firm.  The pectoral muscles were clearly defined
under the tight-fitting waistcoat, the leg, bent over
the table, showed a well-developed thigh and knee.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs eyed him with pleasure, he had a keen
appreciation of a well-built man.  Darwen's brown
eyes seemed continually to meet Carstairs' steady
grey ones, and always there was the light of pleasure
in them.  He went on with his tale, and the others
listened and laughed at the right place, which was
the end.  Carstairs smiled a solemn sort of smile,
The story did not appeal to him very much.
</p>

<p>
Darwen caught the smile, and his own eye seemed
to kindle with an appreciation, though it was his
story.  "What shift are you on?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know yet.  I've got to see Mr Thompson."
</p>

<p>
"He'll be in now, I expect."  With a sudden spring
he threw himself off the table and went to the glass
door.  "There he is, down in the engine room now,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs went out and perceived another very young
man talking to an engine fitter down below.  At that
time Central Stations were very young and most of the
staffs were very young also.  When municipalities were
putting up electric lighting stations faster than men
were being trained to fill them, young men passed
quickly from charge engineer to chief engineer,
and from that to bigger chiefs.  All sorts
and conditions of men drifted into station work.
Now they are drifting out again; sick of councillors
and contractors; sick of mayors and corporations;
sick of red tape and Bumbledom; sick of life.
</p>

<p>
Mr Thompson was smartly, rather horsily dressed.
He eyed Carstairs over somewhat in the manner of a
horse fancier.  He let it be evident also that he was
satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"Have you been round yet?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, not all round," Carstairs answered.
</p>

<p>
"Alright, come round with me."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," Carstairs said.  Thompson, he thought,
was probably only about three or four years older
than himself, and he looked less.  They walked
round together, Thompson explaining and pointing
out peculiarities, Carstairs listening and asking
questions.  In ten minutes they were as chummy as
school boys.
</p>

<p>
"Have you got digs?" Thompson asked, suddenly,
pulling out his watch.
</p>

<p>
"No, not yet."
</p>

<p>
"Well, look here, you'll be on the day shift this
week; you can go out now and get fixed.  Some of
the other fellows will perhaps be able to give you
some addresses."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, I'll try."  Carstairs went up to the
drawing office again.  "I say, can any one put me
up to some digs?"
</p>

<p>
Darwen was leaning over a drawing board doing
some fine work, whistling softly to himself.  "I can,"
he said.  "Half a minute."  He put in one or two
more strokes, then he looked up.  "I've got pretty
decent digs; there's another bedroom empty in the
house I know.  You can share the sitting room with
me, if you like."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are!  What's your address, and how
do I get there?  I'll go round and fix it up at once.
Thompson said I could."

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p>
Carstairs and Darwen were on the same shift
together, that is to say, they put in the same
eight hours of the day at the works, day, evening, or
night; and they shared diggings.  They were about
the same height and the same weight, they were both
extremely interested in their work, both came from
the south of England, and consequently both felt like
strangers in a strange land.  The first evening they
were off, Darwen showed Carstairs round the town.
</p>

<p>
"That's the theatre," he said, with a smile, pointing
to a dingy-looking building in a dingy-looking
street.  He watched Carstairs' face curiously as he
spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I thought it was the prison," Carstairs answered,
with his sober smile.
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed outright.  "This is the last place
God made," he said.
</p>

<p>
They walked round the dingy main streets with
their surging crowd of factory girls and factory men,
flashily dressed in their evening attire, of poor physique
and unhealthy looking.
</p>

<p>
"Is it possible," Carstairs asked, "to get out into
the country?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" Darwen answered.  "Can you walk?"
</p>

<p>
"Pretty fair."
</p>

<p>
"Come on then.  I'll show you a field."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs looked pained.  "The landlady," he
remarked, "described that acre or so of bare earth
opposite our window, as a field."
</p>

<p>
"I know, but this is a real field with grass and all
that."
</p>

<p>
"Come on then," Carstairs said, briskly.
</p>

<p>
Darwen stopped and looked at him impressively.
"Mind, I promise nothing!  But last time I was
there, there were three cows in it."  He suddenly
relaxed into a sunny smile.  "Come on," he said,
and started off briskly.
</p>

<p>
They walked about five miles, past endless rows of
symmetrical, dingy, box-like, red brick houses.  It
was getting dark when they reached the field, but the
cows were there&mdash;three sorry specimens, grazing on
the smoke-grimed, subdued-looking grass.  The young
engineers sat on the gate and looked at them in amused
pity.
</p>

<p>
"We've come through one town, and we're on the
borders of another," Darwen remarked.  "It's hard
to say just what town you're in at any given moment,
about here."
</p>

<p>
"It seems very bracing although it's so smoky,"
Carstairs said.  "I wonder why any one lives here
who could live anywhere else."
</p>

<p>
"Lord!  Don't tell 'em that.  I nearly got
mobbed for making a similar remark last week.  They
think these places are very fine towns.  When they've
made their pile they still stay here."
</p>

<p>
"How long have you been here?"
</p>

<p>
"A month."
</p>

<p>
"How long are you going to stay?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I shall start applying when I've put in four
months.  Might get away at the end of six, then."
</p>

<p>
"That's my idea, too.  They've got some good
plant here, though."
</p>

<p>
So they lapsed into technicalities; and as they
strolled back, the dingy houses and the smoke and
grime were all forgotten.  Community of interest
was drawing these two young men very close together.
They sat up late into the night smoking and comparing
notes of what they had seen and wished to see
in the engineering world.  As they went to bed,
Carstairs passed Darwen's door.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! if you come in half a minute, I'll show you
those drawings," he said.
</p>

<p>
He went in, and while Darwen rummaged about in
a big trunk, Carstairs glanced round his bedroom.
The walls were hung with framed photographs of
football teams and cricket teams, school teams and
town teams; Darwen's handsome features and sturdy
limbs were prominent in all.  Carstairs examined
them with keen interest.  "You're a rugger man, I
see," he said, with great appreciation.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes.  I play, but I haven't got an international
cap, or&mdash;" Carstairs mentioned the name of
one of the teams on the wall.  Darwen stood up with
a roll of engineering drawings in his hand.  He flushed
slightly with pleasure.  "I only played for them one
season," he explained, "left the town at the end of
it."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs looked at the drawings and Darwen
explained.  They sat down together side by side on the
bed; for half an hour longer they discussed
technicalities, then Carstairs went out.  He noticed two
photographs on the mantelpiece as he passed, both
of girls, both pretty.  He noticed also that both of
them were autographed across the corner.  One of
them he thought had "with love" written on it too.
"Shouldn't have thought Darwen was the sort of ass
to get engaged," he said to himself as he went into his
own room and glanced round at the landlady's
wishy-washy prints and cheap ornaments.
</p>

<p>
At the works Carstairs and Darwen were always on
together, with Smith as charge engineer.  On the
night shift (that is, from midnight to eight in the
morning), Smith spent most of his time in the drawing
office reading novels or newspapers, and sleeping; he
took periodical walks round to see that the others
were awake, then he went back into the drawing office
and reclined peacefully in a chair, his head thrown
back against the wall (cushioned by a folded coat),
and his feet supported by a small box.  During the
first two or three hours the two juniors spent their
time tracing out connections behind the switchboard,
making diagrams, and clambering about on the
tops of engines or boilers; later on, they too, usually
dozed off, sprawling over the switchboard desk, or
stretched out on the floor somewhere out of sight.
After about two o'clock a.m. the whole works, in
fact, became a sort of temporary palace of sleep;
the stoker dozed on his box in the boiler house,
the engine driver made himself snug on the bed
plate of an engine, the fires in the boilers died
gradually down from a fierce white to a dull red glow,
the steam pressure gauge dropped back twenty or
thirty pounds, the engines hummed away merrily,
with a rather soothing sort of buzz from the alternator,
and a mild sort of grinding noise from the direct
current dynamos, with a little intermittent sparking
at the brushes.  On the switchboard, the needles of
all the instruments remained steady, the pressure
showing perhaps a little drop.  At irregular intervals
the driver would get up and slowly oil round his
engines, feeling the bearings at the same time; the
stoker would arise and throw a few shovelfuls of
coal on his fires, glance up at his water gauges and
regulate the feed water, perhaps putting the pump on
a little faster, or stopping it off a bit; a switchboard
attendant would open one eye and glance sleepily at
the big voltmeter swung on an arm at the end of the
switchboard, note that the pressure was only a little
way back, and close his eyes again in quiet unconcern.
</p>

<p>
One night Smith had been drinking a lot of strong
tea and couldn't sleep; he strolled round at an
unaccustomed hour and surveyed the sleeping beauties
with a little smile of glee, for Smith was twenty-three
years old, and to the healthy young man at that age
many things appear humorous which a few years
later take on a hue of tragedy.
</p>

<p>
Going through the boiler house, he carefully
examined the steam and water gauges.  Then he
stood for some moments gazing interestedly at the
recumbent stoker; he was rather a ferocious-looking
man in ordinary wakeful moments, but thus, with his
big jaw dropped to its full extent, his eyes closed,
and every feature relaxed, he seemed singularly
feeble.  Smith took a shovel and threw it with a
clatter down on the iron checker plates.
</p>

<p>
It was quite an appreciable number of seconds
before the man moved, then he sprang bolt upright,
with his eyes wide open, both arms extended above
his head, and every expression of alarm on his
countenance; he saw Smith standing there smiling, but
it was some moments before his face resumed its
normal expression; he looked at the shovel on the
iron plates.  "Did you drop that, sir?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Smith answered.
</p>

<p>
"I must a' dropped off," the man said, half
apologetically, half humorously.
</p>

<p>
"I think you must have," Smith agreed, smiling
broadly.
</p>

<p>
A joke loses more than half its zest if there's no
one to share it with.  "I'll have those chaps in the
engine room now.  Come in and see," Smith said,
as he led the way to the engine room door.  The heavy
stoker followed; he was a man over forty, but he
grinned like a boy of twelve.
</p>

<p>
"Half a minute," the engineer said, in a whisper.
Leaving the expectant stoker at the door, he carefully
surveyed the engine room and switchboard, then he
returned with an oil bucket in his hand.  "Shut the
door, and when I switch the lights out, rattle that like
blazes."  He handed over the bucket and crossed
the engine room again to the station-lighting
switchboard, picking up two more buckets as he went.
Then he switched off the main switch, putting the place
in inky darkness; instantly the stoker rattled his
bucket with great vigour.  Smith bowled one of his
along the iron checker plates on top of the pipe trench,
and rattled the other vigorously in his hands.
</p>

<p>
From the security of their corners they heard voices
shouting in the darkness, and the sounds of men in
anger swearing.
</p>

<p>
"What the hell's up?"
</p>

<p>
"Stand by your engine, Jones!"
</p>

<p>
"Got a match?  Let's have a look at the blooming
volts."
</p>

<p>
Smith heard a bump above his head on the switchboard
gallery as though some one had fallen, a match
was struck down in the engine room and another on
the switchboard, then he heard Darwen's voice say,
"Good God!  Smith!  Hullo!  Smith!"
</p>

<p>
He switched on the lights and ran up the
switchboard steps.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was lying limp and helpless on his back
with Darwen bending over him.  Smith turned as
white as a ghost.
</p>

<p>
"What's up?" he asked, in an agitated voice.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know.  Got a shock, I think.  Look at
his hands, got across the contacts in the dark
somehow."
</p>

<p>
They stretched him out on his back with a folded
coat underneath him, and put him through the motions
for artificial respiration.  The driver and stoker
waived ceremony and mounted the switchboard
steps to see what was wrong; they stood leaning
over the prostrate form watching the anxious efforts
of Smith and Darwen in silent, interested sympathy.
"Shall I have a spell, sir?" the brawny stoker asked,
as the agitated Smith paused for a moment in his
efforts.
</p>

<p>
No one present was ever able to say precisely how
long they worked at Carstairs, probably not many
minutes before his chest began to heave in a natural
breathing motion.  They carried him out into the
yard, and the fresh air so revived him that in half
an hour he walked through the engine room unaided,
and lay down on the floor of the drawing office,
made comfortable with coats and newspapers, and
dozed off into a sleep.  When he woke up, and had had
a wash, he seemed quite normal again.
</p>

<p>
Smith was profuse in his apologies.  "I'm beastly
sorry.  I never dreamt of anything of that sort,
etc."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's alright," Carstairs answered, with a sincere
desire to let the matter drop.  "I ought to have stood
still, went shoving my hands out, knew I was somewhere
near the machine switch, too.  Got right past
the guards and touched the bare metal first go off,
wouldn't happen once in a thousand times.  Not your
fault at all."
</p>

<p>
So the incident passed, and remained a secret in
the bosoms of those five men till years later, when,
Carstairs and Darwen were dim and distant memories
at those works, a driver or a stoker would sometimes
tell wondering pupils a tale of how a man was nearly
killed on the night run through the Shift Engineer
"skylarking."
</p>

<p>
Things went very smoothly for a bit.  Darwen
and Carstairs got more chummy than ever.  They
were leaning over the switchboard rail together, it
was not quite a week since Carstairs had got the shock.
"I rather wanted to see a chap get a shock, not
killed, you know," Darwen was saying.
</p>

<p>
"I was rather curious on the point myself, too."
</p>

<p>
"What was it like?  Just a two hundred shock
magnified?"
</p>

<p>
"Very much magnified.  It was devilish."
</p>

<p>
They drifted off.  "I've never seen an alternator
burn out yet, have you?"
</p>

<p>
"No!  Wish number three would go now."
</p>

<p>
They separated to take reading; it was half-past
nine in the evening; Carstairs stood looking at an
ammeter which was set some way above his head.
The divisions on the scale were small and indistinctly
figured; Carstairs stood very close in, on tip-toe,
straining his neck upwards; the high tension fuses
were at the bottom of the board, about level with his
knees (carefully calculated as the most awkward
possible position), they were seven inches long and
enclosed in porcelain pots, which invariably shattered
when a fuse blew.  As Carstairs stood there taking
feeder reading, with what he afterwards learnt was
unnecessary accuracy, the needle of the instrument
he was looking at gave a sudden violent plunge, the fuse
pot, almost touching his trousers, was shattered into
a hundred pieces with a report like a miniature cannon,
and a vivid arc blazed away under his eyes with a
rattling, screaming roar.  Carstairs jumped back
in an instant, to the furthest limit that the width of
the gallery would allow.
</p>

<p>
Darwen came along from the low tension switchboard;
he was all eagerness, his eyes were bright.  He
stopped and looked at his new friend in amazement.
Carstairs cowered against the handrail, gripping his
scribbling block and pencil, palpitating, useless.
</p>

<p>
For two or three seconds Darwen gazed at him in
astonishment.  Then he fetched the long, insulated
crook kept for that purpose, and himself pulled out
the feeder switch.
</p>

<p>
"Bring down your volts, Carstairs," he said, in a
kindly, soothing voice, avoiding his eyes.
</p>

<p>
With a deep, gasping sigh Carstairs pulled himself
together, and with an unsteady hand adjusted the
rheostat.
</p>

<p>
They looked down into the engine room and saw
Thompson, the chief assistant, looking up, watching
them.  He came up the steps and looked at the
shattered fuse pot and burnt slate; he expressed no
surprise, nor even anger; in those early days sparks
and blinding flashes were the daily fare of the electrical
engineer, very much more than they are now.
Thompson picked up one or two of the pieces of partially
fused porcelain and examined them with interest,
then he glanced at Carstairs with a great wonder in
his eyes, but he spoke to Darwen.
</p>

<p>
That night, as they walked home together, Carstairs
was more than usually silent, and the remarks of
Darwen were choppy and abrupt.  They ate their
supper almost in silence, then they lit their pipes and
smoked, in easy chairs, one on each side of the
fireplace.  They puffed in silence for some time, then
Carstairs spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to start applying," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Why?  You haven't been here three months yet!"
</p>

<p>
"No!  Quite so!  But I'm going to look out for
a nice, quiet little job in the country with two low
tension machines, where the wheels are very small,
and fuses never blow."
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap, you'll get over that; the first one
I saw go knocked me all in a heap."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs appreciated Darwen's sympathetic lying,
but it cut him more than all.  "Don't give me silly
lies, for God's sake," he said, letting his temper get
the better of him.  "I have found out that I am a
skunk with no nerve, not a ha'porth, so I drop behind,
into my place, the place of the cur.  And the bottom
is knocked out of my universe."  He puffed vigorously
at his pipe, blowing great clouds of smoke.
</p>

<p>
Darwen was silent, too, for some time, then he spoke
slowly, thoughtfully, punctuating his remarks by
blowing softly at the wreaths of smoke about him.
"I must say (puff), honestly (puff), I was never more
surprised in my life (puff).  You're such a deliberate,
cool sort of chap (puff).  Thought earthquakes
wouldn't upset you."
</p>

<p>
"Damn it!  I thought so too."
</p>

<p>
Darwen proceeded: "Surely must be something
abnormal (puff).  I mean to say, a fuse going is
startling, and all that&mdash;but (puff), damn it! (puff)
you haven't got over that shock, you know, that's
what it is."  He sat upright with a sudden vigour
and a light in his expressive eyes.  "That's it, man.
You want to go slow for a bit.  Dash it! two thousand
volts, that usually 'corpses' a chap, you know."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs brightened somewhat.  "Yes," he said,
"I'm convinced that's it, too, but how long will it
take to get over it?  If ever?"  He stood up
excitedly; it was obvious he was not himself even then.
His hand was unsteady as he held his pipe outwards,
pointing with the stem at Darwen.  "That shock
was devilish, Darwen.  A nightmare.  Devilish.  I
could feel you chaps working at me, for hours it seemed
to me, working so damn slowly.  And I wanted to
tell you to get on, to keep it up, to go faster, and I
couldn't, couldn't budge, couldn't get out a word.
Did I sweat?  You didn't notice if I sweated.  Think
I must have.  There was a sensation of something
fluttering round me, something like a damn great
moth in the dark.  I could hear it, and I was frightened
of the thing, frightened as hell.  I wanted to put my
arm up to shield my eyes, to beat the thing off, to
lash out in sheer terror, and I couldn't budge.  God!
It was awful!  I had no idea terror was so really
terrible.  Wonder what the moth thing was?"
</p>

<p>
Darwen looked at him steadily with bright eyes,
a world of sympathy in them, sympathy and interest.
"Your face was very drawn, I noticed that.  You
looked terror-stricken."
</p>

<p>
"I was.  And when that fuse went to-night, the
bang and the flash and roar brought it all back.  I
lost control of myself.  I wanted to be steady, but I
couldn't, I shook like a leaf; you saw it, and Thompson
saw it.  You'd hardly believe how angry I was, how
I was cursing myself."  He broke off suddenly and
shook his clenched fist in the air.  "Curse that blasted
silly Smith and his blasted monkey tricks."  It was
almost a scream.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down, old chap.  You want a rest, that's what
it is&mdash;shock to the system and that sort of thing, you
know.  I'll go round with you in the morning and see
a doctor."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs sat down, he seemed almost himself
again; calm, discerning, calculating.  "Can't do that!
What am I to say?  Sure to get old Smith into a
row.  These bally doctors and councillors they're all
mixed up, you know, sure to get round."
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap, damn Smith!  You have yourself
to consider."
</p>

<p>
"He'd get the sack; it would wreck him.  His
people are not very well off; he told me once that
before he came here he was getting a quid a week in
London&mdash;and living on it."
</p>

<p>
Darwen spread out his hands with an almost
continental gesture.  "My dear chap, you're following
quite an erroneous line of reasoning, it's rather a pet
theory of mine, as an engineer.  However, tell the
doctor you had an accident in the execution of your
duty, etc., etc.  No need for it to get round at all.
He'll forget all about you as soon as you've paid him
his fee."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was thoughtful, he puffed his pipe in
silence for some minutes, then he stood up.  "Alright,
let's go to two while we're about it, then we can check
'em one on the other.  I'm going to bed."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<p>
In the morning Carstairs and Darwen went
together to first one doctor and then another.
Their verdicts were remarkably alike.  "Shock! you'll
feel the effects for some time.  You really want
a month's rest."
</p>

<p>
"Shall I get alright again in a month?" Carstairs
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Probably, most probably."
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do?" Darwen asked
when they got outside.  "Ask for a month?"
</p>

<p>
"No!" Carstairs answered, definitely.  "Smith's
the sort of chap who'd own up at once if the subject
were brought up; I'll sit it out, now I know it's only
temporary, I don't mind.  The thought of it
otherwise fairly took the stuffing out of me."
</p>

<p>
Darwen reasoned with him.  "My dear chap, you
fly in the face of providence all the way round.  As an
engineer you should have learnt to pursue truth
relentlessly."
</p>

<p>
"That is my desire," Carstairs grunted.
</p>

<p>
"Well, the elementary truth underlying all things
is that a man's first duty is to himself.  When you
introduce sentimental side issues, you overload
yourself and consequently shorten the run of your
existence.  You also render it less pleasant."
</p>

<p>
"What are my sentimental side issues?  I'm not
engaged on anything of that sort."  Carstairs shot a
quick glance at Darwen.
</p>

<p>
He was quite unmoved.  "Your idea about screening
Smith, etc.  The fool must pay the penalty of his
folly.  Smith is a fool.  In the great scheme of the
Universe all things are interdependent.  Naturalists
say that if there had been no worms there would be
no men, and an engineer is a man who uses this
interdependence to his own advantage."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs gave a grudging assent.  "Where is the
limit?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I see no limit," Darwen answered.
</p>

<p>
"Then you're a common or garden rogue."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps!  Rogue is so often simply a term
applied by fools to men smarter than themselves.
However, I said, 'I see no limit'; I should add 'as
yet.'  My theory is incomplete, I am expanding it as
I grow older."
</p>

<p>
"You'll expand yourself into prison if you don't
look out."
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed.  "Have you read 'The Prince'?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"You're an ignorant chap, Carstairs.  I'll lend it
to you."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  What's it about, engines?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;men."
</p>

<p>
"Then I won't borrow it, thanks all the same."
</p>

<p>
"It's part of my theory that every man should be
a sort of little Prince, as far as his intellect, etc., will
allow him."
</p>

<p>
"Hear, hear!  Go on."
</p>

<p>
"Well, the essential part of a prince's job is
handling men."
</p>

<p>
"So is an engineer's."
</p>

<p>
"Hear! hear! to that.  Now our views begin
to converge.  The engineer is essentially analytical
and mathematical.  Why not apply his abilities to
men as well as engines, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"No reason at all."
</p>

<p>
"Good! then as in engineering it is necessary not
only to have theory, but practice as well, practise,
practise, practise, eh?  We will experiment so that
we may know the limit of the truth of our theories, so
that we may know and recognize the little difficulties
that crop up in the application of all theories.  On the
night shift next week we'll experiment on Smith and
Jones and Foulkes."
</p>

<p>
The following week as they were preparing to go on
night shift together, Carstairs noticed that the
landlady put up a bag of large onions for Darwen.  "What
in thunder are those things for?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"The experiment.  We'll see if we can persuade
those other chaps to eat raw onions.  I believe you can
make most men do anything if you have observed
them closely and drawn accurate deduction from
your observations.  Now Foulkes, the stoker, is a
strong, hard-headed sort of chap, but he's immensely
impressed with his own hardihood.  We'll attack him
on that side.  Twig?"
</p>

<p>
"I think a sledge-hammer would be a more
appropriate weapon to tackle old Foulkes with."
</p>

<p>
"That's the good old masculine idea.  In these
things you want to take a line from the feminine."
</p>

<p>
"Alright.  I'll be a spectator."
</p>

<p>
So shortly after midnight Carstairs and Darwen
repaired to the boiler house.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Foulkes," Darwen said, cheerily.  "How
did you sleep to-day?"
</p>

<p>
Foulkes was gruff and hearty.  "I can sleep any
time," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Lucky dog! wish I could.  My landlady
recommended me to eat onions.  Jolly good things, but
they burn my mouth out."
</p>

<p>
Foulkes laughed, a great guffaw.
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed too.  "I suppose," he said, "that
they don't have any effect on you.  I daresay you
could eat 'em like apples."  He pulled an onion from his
pocket and threw it up and caught it.  "I've heard
of chaps with very strong heads being able to do it,"
he remarked, gazing at the onion in his hand
tentatively.  "I couldn't tackle 'em like that.  No more
could you, Foulkes."
</p>

<p>
Foulkes stretched out a big, black paw.  "Give
me ta onion," he said.
</p>

<p>
Darwen handed it over.  "I bet you'll soon chuck it."
</p>

<p>
They stood and watched.  Carstairs very solemn,
Darwen with just a flicker of a smile of satisfaction,
as the big stoker ate the best part of a raw onion till
the tears ran down his cheeks and he almost gasped
for breath.  Darwen kept him at it.  "That's beaten
you, Foulkes, you can't go on with it."  But he did,
and finished it.
</p>

<p>
As they turned to the engine room Darwen said:
"How's that for an experiment."
</p>

<p>
"I call it underhand, unsporting."
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap, you don't give sporting chances to
an engine."  He looked at Carstairs curiously.  "We
have different methods of looking at things; I wonder
who will prove most successful in the end."
</p>

<p>
"Your experiment would have failed any way if
Foulkes hadn't been a plucky, obstinate sort of chap."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  That goes to prove the correctness of
my observations.  I had placed Foulkes rightly as
the man to eat onions.  That is to say, to eat an entire
onion.  The successful man is the man who can make
others eat onions, and also pair up the right man
with the right onion.  I have an ambition to be a
successful man."
</p>

<p>
"So have I, but I also wish to play the game."
</p>

<p>
"Again we disagree, I wish to collar the stakes."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was silent for some time.  "Let us agree
to differ.  You don't mean all you say, or all that
your words convey to me.  You're a sportsman."
</p>

<p>
"That's true.  I'm somewhat hampered by a
sporting instinct, and if I followed my theory to its
logical conclusion, I should not now be reasoning
with you."
</p>

<p>
They sat down on the switchboard and glanced
over the technical papers that were just out that day.
</p>

<p>
Two months passed away and Carstairs found to
his very great pleasure that his nerves had regained
their normal steadiness.  He and Darwen were both
scanning the advertisement columns of the technical
press with great anxiety and interest; they were both
answering advertisements, and they had come to an
agreement not to both apply for the same job.  They
were watching with eager interest a town in the south
of England.  They had both seen tenders out for
plant about a year ago; then they saw an advertisement
for a chief engineer.
</p>

<p>
"In about a month he'll want shifts," Carstairs said.
</p>

<p>
Now the advertisement was before them, set out
with much pomp and ceremony among a long list of
other stuff.  Three shift engineers at a salary of £104
per annum.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs felt a singular sense of satisfaction as he
surveyed the advertisement.  "We'll toss for first
choice as usual, I suppose," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Of course," Darwen answered.  "They'll never
select two chaps from one station, and I'm certain it
reduces the chances of both."  He threw a coin in
the air.
</p>

<p>
"Tails," Carstairs said.
</p>

<p>
Darwen turned it up.  "Tails" it was.  "There
you are," he said, with a genial smile, pocketing the
coin.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs wrote out his application, and copied his
testimonials with great care on unruled foolscap.
About a fortnight later, Thompson, the chief assistant,
called him into his office.
</p>

<p>
He picked up a letter from his desk.  "I've got a
letter from Southville in reference to your application
for Shift Engineer.  The chief there asks my
recommendation between you and Darwen."
</p>

<p>
"Darwen?" Carstairs repeated in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
Thompson glanced at the letter.  "Yes, Darwen,"
he said.  He hummed and hesitated a minute, while
Carstairs was turning over various thoughts and
reasons in his mind.  "You see it's a new job,
Carstairs.  I have a very high opinion of your
abilities.  The testing and that, that we have done
together, but&mdash;er&mdash;things are always going wrong
in a new job, you know.  I think it will be better for
you if you stay here till you get more accustomed to
fuses, etc., going."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs flushed; from his neck to the roots of his
hair he was a vivid red.  Thompson looked down at
the letter he held in his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Then you're recommending Darwen?" Carstairs asked.
</p>

<p>
"Ye-es, I think, for a new job, you understand.
Darwen would be rather more suitable.  I tell you
this because I thought probably Darwen would tell
you, and you might misinterpret my action."
</p>

<p>
Thompson was a sportsman, he liked to have things
square and aboveboard.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks!  I understand," Carstairs said, and went
out.  He crossed the engine room and looked for Darwen.
</p>

<p>
"So you're putting your theory into practice,"
he said, looking Darwen sternly in the eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" he asked, flushing angrily,
and Carstairs couldn't help thinking what a
remarkably handsome fellow he was.
</p>

<p>
"Why, you've got Southville."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know.  Thompson told me just now.  What
about it?"
</p>

<p>
"You're a damn skunk, that's all.  I won the toss."
</p>

<p>
"You're a liar or a fool, and I'll punch your head
if you call me a skunk."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs looked at him in astonishment, his anger
seemed so genuine and righteous.  "You're welcome
to try any time you like," he answered.
</p>

<p>
Darwen gazed at him a moment, then he suddenly
smiled.  "Look here, old chap, I can see you believe
you're in the right, but I assure you you're not.  I'm
positive I won the toss."
</p>

<p>
"And I'm equally positive I won it."
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap, I held the coin right under your
eyes, and I remember distinctly it was a tail."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely; that's what I guessed."
</p>

<p>
Darwen's face seemed to lighten with a sudden
comprehension.  "I'm devilish sorry," he said.  "I
remember now.  I didn't notice particularly at the
time what you said.  I was watching the coin.
"Head" is so often the choice that I assumed it was
head.  Look here, I'll withdraw my application.  I'll
tell Thompson."  He started off.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs followed, and stopped him at the office.
"Let it go now, Darwen," he said.
</p>

<p>
Thompson looked from one to the other inquiringly.
Darwen explained.
</p>

<p>
"It's too late now, any way," Thompson said.
"The letter's gone.  I think it's best as it is, too."
</p>

<p>
They went out into the engine room again together.
Darwen was profuse, more than profuse, in his
apologies.  "I'd sooner almost anything had happened
than this," he said.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs watched him closely.  "Oh, it doesn't
matter.  Let's drop it," he said.
</p>

<p>
In a week Darwen left for Southville.  They
parted excellent friends, almost the same as before
the unpleasant incident, but not quite.  There was
a "something."
</p>

<p>
The new man who came to fill Darwen's place was
very bumptious and very conceited, the son of a
large shopkeeper.  He would have been a decent
fellow if he had not been so conceited.  For his first
time on night shift he was as lively as a cricket for
the first two hours, singing and whistling and trying
to startle the stoker and driver by dropping heavy
spanners on the checker plates unawares, etc.; then he
announced loudly that he'd "keep the beggars awake."
</p>

<p>
At three o'clock Smith found him tilted back in
his chair, mouth wide open, fast asleep.  Smith's
eyes sparkled, he gently called Carstairs; they both
repaired to the drawing office and came back with
bottles of ink of various colours&mdash;red, green, black,
and purple&mdash;and two fine camel-hair brushes: delicately
and with great care they painted his face with
streaks and circles and elaborate scrolls of many
colours; every now and again during the process
the sleeper raised a hand to brush away the flies.  He
turned his head uneasily occasionally too, but they
finished it in style, and stood back to regard their
masterpiece with keen satisfaction; he looked a
most fearsome warrior.  Then they stood back and
dropped a heavy book with a bang on the floor.  He
jumped up startled, but saw them laughing.
</p>

<p>
"I wasn't asleep," he said, with a self-satisfied
pomposity.
</p>

<p>
"Pretty nearly, though," Smith suggested.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, I wasn't.  I bet you don't catch me
asleep."
</p>

<p>
Smith smiled.  "Alright, don't get your hair off,"
he said; he strolled towards the steps, Carstairs
followed, and the new man dropped in behind.  They
strolled across the engine room in solemn procession,
and the engine driver, catching sight of the new man's
face, went off into shrieks of hysterical laughter.
Smith and Carstairs took no notice, but the new man
hurried up alongside, frowning severely, which added
exceedingly to the comic effect of his countenance.
</p>

<p>
"That chap's mad, I think," he said.
</p>

<p>
The other two turned and looked at the driver with
a sort of tolerant good humour.  "He is a bit touched,
I think," Smith observed.  "He's been in India for
a long time&mdash;in the army, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Cheeky brute, he broke out like that when he
saw me.  I'll ask him what the hell he's laughing at
if he doesn't shut up."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind him," they said, "he can't help it,
he'll be alright in a minute."  They went out into
the boiler house and the new man followed; the
stoker was asleep on his box against the wall; they
paused, all three, and stood looking at him.
</p>

<p>
"They are a drowsy lot, these chaps," the new man
remarked.  "See me wake him up."  He picked up
a heavy firing iron, and, standing in front of the stoker,
dropped it on the iron plates with a huge clatter.
</p>

<p>
The stoker&mdash;he had been in a very light doze&mdash;jumped
up instantly and stood fronting the new man, face to
face, directly under a lamp; for fully half a minute
he stared, in speechless, motionless, wonder, then he
burst forth into mighty guffaws that shook the very
building.  He caught sight of the others standing a
few yards off.
</p>

<p>
"Strike me pink!  Take 'im away.  Take 'im
away," he moaned in piteous appeal, squirming
painfully with his hand on his stomach.
</p>

<p>
The new man stared at him in petrified rage and
astonishment.  "What the hell is the matter with you?"
he asked.  "You were asleep," he said, severely, "and
it's no use trying to pass it off by laughing."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go away, go away."  The stoker motioned
with brawny hand and averted face.  He took a
sideways glance out of one eye, and burst forth
into fresh paroxysms.
</p>

<p>
Smith and Carstairs retired somewhat precipitately
into the yard, and under the friendly shade
of night, behind a big cable drum, they screamed
in unison.
</p>

<p>
The new man after vainly endeavouring to quell
the stoker with a frown, went back to the engine room
again; as he opened the door the driver, who was
just mopping his eyes with a red cotton handkerchief,
caught sight of him and burst forth anew.
</p>

<p>
Smitten with a sudden suspicion, the new man
glanced hastily over his clothing and passed his
handkerchief over his face, but the ink was quite dry
and gave no evidence.
</p>

<p>
"Everybody in this place seems to be mad to-night,"
he said, and the driver screamed louder.
</p>

<p>
With increased suspicion, the new man went off to
the lavatory and looked in the glass.  What he said
is not known, but later, when Smith and Carstairs
returned to the drawing office, they found him with
a clean face.  He didn't look up when they entered,
but continued to read in moody silence.  They sat
down and read too, while the stoker and driver at the
door of the engine room conferred notes with much
laughter.
</p>

<p>
Not very long after the stoker appeared at the
glass door of the drawing office.  He knocked and
came inside; his face was pale beneath its grime,
and his eyes were full of apprehension, which he
endeavoured not to show.
</p>

<p>
"Low water in number five boiler, sir," he said.
</p>

<p>
All three were on their feet in an instant.
</p>

<p>
Probably eighty per cent. of boiler explosions are due
to low water.  Smith's merry, boyish face grew pale
and stern, as he moved quickly to the door.  "How
the devil is that?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Dunno, sir.  Check valve hung up, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Have you lost sight of it altogether?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."  The gruff, hearty man was very meek.
</p>

<p>
They arrived at the boiler house, all four.  Smith
looked at the water gauge glasses and blew them
through.
</p>

<p>
"How long have you lost it?"
</p>

<p>
"Only just noticed it, sir."
</p>

<p>
Smith stood for a moment, his hand on the check
valve, his eyes far away.  The weight of responsibility
comes early on these young men, especially if
they have a tendency to skylarking and letting things
drift occasionally; as a rule they look old beyond
their years.
</p>

<p>
Only for a moment Smith hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Damp your fires!  Get some of those wet ashes
and cover them over!  Let the stream drop and shut
this one in as soon as it's back twenty pounds!"  He
stood in front of the boiler and watched the stoker
throw ashes on the fires; he looked a different man;
he was very steady and calm.  This young man with
the vulgar name of Smith had some excellent British
blood in his veins, as who shall say in England here,
that any navvy in the street has not?
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stood behind him, his heart beating
considerably faster; only the day before he had been
reading a detailed account of a disastrous boiler
explosion.  He felt a tingling, pricking sensation
in his blood; afterwards he learnt to look for this
tingling of the blood, it was one of his chief sources
of enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
The big stoker watched Smith very intently with
a sort of child-like dependent observation.  He
obeyed his instructions quietly but quickly, very
quickly.  He was very silent, and very meek, but
there was a tinge almost of fever in his movements.
</p>

<p>
The new man watched them for a moment, then with
every assumption of languor he strolled off&mdash;and he
did not come back till the boiler was shut in and the
pressure very low.
</p>

<p>
When, after about half an hour, everything seemed
safe again, Smith gave a sigh of relief as he and
Carstairs returned to the engine room.  "I don't
mind sparks, but I'm darned if I like steam," he said.
He looked at Carstairs with approval.  "You didn't
seem to be very much impressed."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs smiled, his slow, steady smile.  "As a
matter of fact, I felt like a chap who's found a bomb
and doesn't quite know whether it's exploded or
about to explode, or whether it really is a bomb."
</p>

<p>
That night as Carstairs went home his ambitions
began to soar very high again.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p>
At the end of a month Darwen wrote a rather
long letter, giving a detailed description of
the station and staff.  "The plant is good," he wrote,
"all brand new and full of possibilities.  The chief
assistant is a delightful thickhead, and the chief&mdash;words
fail me to describe him.  The possibilities and
probabilities of this job are immense."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs read it through twice carefully and
thoughtfully; he penned a brief reply.  "No news
here.  New man an utter ass, blown out with conceit,
impossible to share digs with him."  That was about
all, it was almost telegraphic.
</p>

<p>
At the works things went on much as usual.
Thompson made more than usual overtures of friendliness;
he wished to impress on Carstairs that it was
through no feeling of personal bias that he had not
recommended him for the Southville job.  Frequently
when they were testing with high tension currents he
caught Thompson looking at him with a sort of wonder
and distinct approval.
</p>

<p>
One day when there was a fault on the mains, and
Thompson had been out all night in the rain testing
and digging out cables and opening junction boxes
till he was tired and weary of all the world, he came
into the works in a fine spirit of irritation.  "We'll
have to burn the damn thing out," he said.  "Run
up a machine on it."
</p>

<p>
By a specially complicated arrangement of the
already complicated switchboard, it was possible to
run any machine on any feeder.  The Shift Engineer
signalled for another machine, and Carstairs plugged
her in on the faulty circuit.  The fuse held for about
one minute, then it blew with a flash and a bang right
in Carstairs' face.  Promptly and coolly he switched
out and went through the complicated operation
necessary to isolate that section.
</p>

<p>
Thompson watched him in some surprise.  "You've
got used to fuses, then," he said.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs flushed.  "Er&mdash;" he hesitated a moment.
Thompson waited in expectant silence, which is the
severest cross-examination to a very young man.  "I
got a shock some time ago and it upset my nerves a
bit.  I'm alright now."
</p>

<p>
"It does upset you if you get it badly.  What did
you get, four hundred?"
</p>

<p>
"Two thousand."
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord.  That's usually fatal.  How did you
manage it?"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was silent for a moment; he looked at
Smith who was down below in the engine room, then
he turned and faced Thompson.
</p>

<p>
"It was my own fault.  I was fooling about, trying
some experiments, you know&mdash;and tired.  It knocked
me over.  Smith and Darwen brought me round;
Smith was jolly decent.  You needn't say anything
to him about it if you don't mind, it was his
request."  He looked Thompson steadily in the eyes like a
practised liar.
</p>

<p>
Thompson smiled with a sort of admiration and
pleasure.  "You'll be more careful next time," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I shall, very careful," Carstairs answered, and
Thompson smiled; he started to go away, but turned
at the head of the steps.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't be in a hurry to leave this job if I were
you.  If a vacancy occurs, I think I can promise you
a Shift Engineer job here."  He went down the steps.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs felt a glow of exultation.  "Thanks very
much," he said.
</p>

<p>
It has been observed that misfortunes never come
singly, it is equally true that good fortune comes in
lumps also.  The observant man like the successful
gambler may gain much profit by regulating his
actions to the ebb and flow of fortune.  What appears
to the casual or timid observer to be a particularly
"long shot" is often the outcome of close observation,
and not the mere freak of a desperate plunger.
The tide of affairs never sets either way without
warning.  The watchful man, like the careful mariner,
knows fairly well what to expect.  Carstairs was a
particularly close observer, and after Thompson's
remarks and other things, he had an idea that the
luck was flowing his way again; he was not much
surprised therefore to find a letter waiting for him
next morning from Darwen telling him of a vacancy
at Southville, and urging him to run down and see
the chief.  "I have so strongly recommended you
that I think the job is yours," he said.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs felt a singular satisfaction that he had
gauged the trend of his luck so accurately.  He went
down to the works to see Thompson and get a day off.
Thompson looked rather disappointed.  "You'll get
that alright," he said, "but I'm rather sorry.  I've
had an inquiry about Smith here (he held up a letter),
there'll probably be a vacancy soon.  I suppose you
don't think it worth while waiting?"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stood for a few minutes in deep thought.
"I think it would be rather stemming the tide of my
luck, wouldn't it?" he remarked, quite seriously.
</p>

<p>
Thompson smiled.  "Alright.  I'll write to the
chief at Southville telling him I have had reason to
considerably improve my opinion of you."
</p>

<p>
A slightly increased colour mantled on Carstairs'
cheek.  "Thanks! if you will," he said.  Next day
he went to Southville.  He saw the chief and was
appointed there and then.  He spent the rest of the
day with Darwen who showed a somewhat un-English
effusion in his greeting.  They strolled round the
pleasant southern town together.
</p>

<p>
"This is civilization," Darwen said.
</p>

<p>
"That's so," Carstairs agreed.
</p>

<p>
In a week he left the grimy, little midland town,
but before he went, there was a solemn gathering of
the shift engineers and switchboard attendants in
the drawing office for the purpose of presenting him
with a standard work on electricity (Darwen had had
a silver cigarette case).  Smith made the presentation.
In a somewhat nervous little speech, he expressed
regret at Carstairs' departure, and rosy hopes of his
future, with a few glowing tributes to his personal
qualities.  Carstairs thanked them very solemnly,
and deflected the glowing tributes on to the assembled
company.  These little gatherings were a recognized
institution in Central Stations; about every three or
four months there would be a "whip round" of half
a crown or so each to present some man who had been
there about six months with a small token of esteem
on the occasion of his departure to a better job.  Some
men have quite a collection of pipes, cigarette cases,
walking sticks, slide rules, books, etc.
</p>

<p>
Just before he left the works for the last time,
Foulkes, the stoker, accosted him.
</p>

<p>
"There was some gipsy-looking bloke asking if a
man called Carstairs worked here, yesterday," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Did he say he wanted to see me?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, just asked if you worked here."
</p>

<p>
"What did you tell him?"
</p>

<p>
"I said you'd just got another job at Southville."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was very serious.  "What was he like?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not quite as tall as you, sir.  A rough-looking
cove.  Walked with a bit of a limp, like as though
he'd bin shot or something sometime."
</p>

<p>
"A young man?"
</p>

<p>
"'Bout the same age as yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Ah.  Poor devil!  Limp, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Not much, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Still quite enough, I expect.  Poor devil!  Well,
thanks very much, Foulkes, good-bye."  Carstairs
held out his hand.  "May bump up against you
again some day.  Good-bye!"
</p>

<p>
He turned and walked out across the yard, and the
burly stoker looked after him with interest and curiosity.
"They comes and goes," he soliloquized.  "Rum
thing about that gipsy bloke, still it ain't no business
o' mine."  Which was a point of view he had acquired
in the army.
</p>

<p>
Darwen met Carstairs on the platform at Southville
station.
</p>

<p>
"You're on with me for the first week," he said.
His marvellous eyes sparkled with delight.  "Where's
your luggage?  I've got a cab waiting.  The new
digs (I swopped this morning) are about two miles out,
first-class place; thirty bob a week each.  You don't
mind that, do you?  Piano too.  Do you vamp?
Never mind, I can do enough for two."
</p>

<p>
He seemed unusually excited.  Carstairs couldn't
help feeling flattered at the obvious pleasure his
arrival caused.
</p>

<p>
As they rattled away in the cab, Darwen explained:
"I'm jolly glad you've come, sort of levels up over
that misunderstanding about this job."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! that's all right."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is now.  You're a damn good sort, you
know, Carstairs.  You and I ought to run this job.
Chief and chief assistant.  How would that suit
you?"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs smiled, a steady smile.  "First-class,"
he answered.
</p>

<p>
Darwen was watching him closely, he seemed quite
exultant at Carstairs' reply.  "I knew it would.
You wait till you see the chief and chief assistant
here, they're not fit to run a mud dredger."
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you sack 'em then?" Carstairs
laughed.
</p>

<p>
Darwen's eyes glittered strangely.  "By Jove,
that's it, they can't stick it much longer.  Don't you
see.  Damme!  I wouldn't give either of 'em a shift
engineer's job."
</p>

<p>
"He seemed alright when I interviewed him."
</p>

<p>
Darwen snapped his fingers impatiently.  "Bah!
He's civil and all that, but he'll never be an engineer."
</p>

<p>
They pulled up at the diggings, a nice-looking
semi-detached villa, with big, bay windows, and a
well-kept front garden.
</p>

<p>
"This is alright," Carstairs commented, "if the
grub's any good."
</p>

<p>
"Leave that to me, old chap.  There's a daughter
in the house, not bad looking."
</p>

<p>
"Go steady, Darwen."
</p>

<p>
"I'm as safe as houses, old chap!  She's engaged
to a grocer's assistant in the town here, and describes
herself as 'a young lady'; 'me and two other young
ladies,' you know the sort."
</p>

<p>
"H'm&mdash;ye-es."
</p>

<p>
They got the luggage stowed away and sat down
in the sitting-room, a large room on the second floor
with a big, bay window looking out on the quiet
tree-shaded road.  Some of Darwen's technical books
and papers were scattered on the table; there were
two big easy chairs and a comfortable-looking couch
with numerous cushions scattered about; the carpet
was light-coloured and thick.  The general tone of
the room was light, a sort of drawing-room effect.
Probably to the expert feminine eye the curtains and
other things were old and cheap, and dirty, and
everything dusty.  To Carstairs, straight from the dingy
north, it appeared a palace.  He threw himself into
an easy chair and putting his legs up on another,
sighed with content.
</p>

<p>
"This is jolly good, after that grimy hole!"
</p>

<p>
Darwen looked at him with sympathy.  "That's
so," he agreed.  He sat down at the piano.  "This
isn't a bad instrument," he observed, "it is stipulated
that the daughter may be allowed to play on it
when she likes."
</p>

<p>
"Oh; the devil!"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all."  He sounded one or two notes
thoughtfully, then he glided off into something slow
and soothing with a tinge of melancholy in it too.
He stopped and looked at Carstairs critically.  "That's
how you feel," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Precisely," Carstairs answered.  "What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Chopin's Nocturne."
</p>

<p>
"Never heard of it."
</p>

<p>
"No?  It's not supposed to appeal to the vulgar
mind," Darwen laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, do it again.  I like it."
</p>

<p>
Darwen swung round on the stool and "did it
again," and went on and on, seeming to lose himself;
his long, artistic fingers moved with a graceful, loving
poise across the white keys.  He stopped abruptly
and wheeled round.  "How's that?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"First-class," Carstairs answered.
</p>

<p>
"What did you think of while I was playing?"
</p>

<p>
"What I want to do.  As a matter of fact I elucidated
a knotty point in connection with an idea I'm
working out."
</p>

<p>
Darwen's dark eyes lighted up into a positive
gleam.  "It's curious," he said.  "I bet when old
Chopin composed that thing he had no ideas of
electrical machinery in his head.  What's the line of
the invention?"  He swung round and toyed with the
keys; a low, sweet strain welled out, pleading, winning.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it occurred to me one day that there was
no adequate reason why&mdash;"  Carstairs stopped,
seemingly interrupted by his own thoughts.  "No," he
said, as if speaking to himself.  "It's not quite right
after all."  He laughed aloud suddenly.  "The
reasons," he said in his normal voice, "appear more
and more adequate as I investigate the case, still&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Darwen waited in expectation for some time, but
Carstairs remained silent, lost in thought.  Suddenly
Darwen burst into life and rolled out an immense
volume of sound from the piano.
</p>

<p>
A look of pain crossed Carstairs' features.  "What
the devil do you make that row for?"
</p>

<p>
"That row, as you call it, is from Wagner's
'Lohengrin.'"
</p>

<p>
"Is that so?  Well, it's a jolly good imitation of
a breakdown in the engine room."
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed.  "You have a vulgar mind, old
chap."  He branched off into an Hungarian waltz.
</p>

<p>
"That's better."
</p>

<p>
"Suited to your taste, you mean."  He wandered
on through numerous scraps of dance music.  "Do
you dance, Carstairs?"
</p>

<p>
"Not much."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you must.  You and I are going strong this
winter."
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to work."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so, so am I.  So much that the average
man considers work is painful, misdirected effort.
Do you want results, financial results?"
</p>

<p>
"You can bet your boots on that."
</p>

<p>
Darwen's fingers moved very slowly, it was a slow
waltz tune, very slow; his gaze was far away.  "The
whole world is a shop," he said, speaking very slowly.
"Everything is bought and sold; the most successful
salesman is not the man who has the best goods, but
he who shows them most advantageously.  We sell
our brains, you and I, our brains and nerves.  The
buyers are the Corporation; this collection of
greengrocers, drapers, lawyers, doctors, and one navvy.
They are entirely incapable of judging our technical
abilities, they rely on the opinion of a fool; a sort of
promoted wireman, the chief."  The music ceased
altogether, and he wheeled round facing Carstairs.
"And however much you grind, and swot, and work,
this fool (who only got his job because these people
are unable to distinguish between a man who can use
his hands and one who can use his head) will always
fix your market value, and by his own little standard.
The obvious conclusion is to get a better place in the
shop window than the fool occupies."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was silent.
</p>

<p>
"Do you agree with that?"
</p>

<p>
"Conditionally; depends on the method adopted."
</p>

<p>
Darwen blazed out into a sudden anger.  "You're
a fool, Carstairs.  You and your methods.  It doesn't
matter a curse to you how you generate your electricity,
does it?  You want results, that's all!  The correct
methods are the most successful, the most economical."  He
sobered down again suddenly and smiled.  "Look
here, Carstairs, I want to make this job, yours and
mine, worth more than it is.  I like this town and I
want to stay here, but I must get some bally pay."
</p>

<p>
"Hear, hear!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm going to work the oracle.  I'm going
to know every man on the council, then I'm going to
apply for a rise."
</p>

<p>
"I'm with you entirely."
</p>

<p>
"These things are easily worked.  A man who's
not handling his own money is very generous to his
friends.  Can you lie?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm an expert."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we shall want to lie sometimes.  The age
of truth has not yet arrived, and the man who sticks
to the truth is before his time, consequently he's not
appreciated, which means, he's not paid.  I want pay.
How's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Very good."
</p>

<p>
"I think so too.  The mistake most people make is
not knowing when to lie.  To be a good liar requires
more brains and just as much pluck as to tell the truth."
</p>

<p>
A slow smile flickered round Carstairs' face.  "You
introduce me to the proper people, and I'll tell 'em
unblushingly that we're two jolly smart engineers
very much underpaid."
</p>

<p>
"That's the idea!  And they'll believe you, such
is the paradox of this lying and trustful generation."
</p>

<p>
These young men, it will be seen, were very young,
but their wisdom was much in excess of the
pig-headed obstinacy of the average greybeard.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<p>
The works at Southville were rather larger than
the works he had just left in the Midlands,
and Carstairs felt a delightful sense of exaltation as
he first took charge of a shift by himself.  For eight
hours he was entirely responsible for the efficient,
economical, and safe working of about 6000 horsepower
of plant.  He felt a sense of responsibility, of
age; he felt uplifted and steadied.  He was very
thoughtful, but very confident; he had taken great
pains during the week he was on with Darwen to make
himself thoroughly acquainted with everything about
the station.  His confidence was the direct outcome
of his knowledge; he looked at the various engines,
dynamos, boilers and switch gears, and felt that he
fully grasped the why and wherefore of it all; he
reviewed the possibilities of what might happen,
what might break down, in the various component
parts of the complicated whole, and what he would
do to tackle it.  He considered it all very solemnly
and felt very confident; he knew he would not scare.
Physically he was in the pink of condition, his head
was very clear and his technical knowledge very bright
from constant use.
</p>

<p>
The chief, an awkward-looking, flabby man, came
down to see him on his first shift.  "Well! do you
think you can manage it?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Carstairs answered, looking his chief
steadily in the eyes; the eyes were lack-lustre and
heavy, they shifted uneasily and roamed round the
engine room: he stepped up to a bit of bright brass
work and rubbed his finger across it.  "That won't
do," he said, holding up a finger soiled with greasy
dirt.  "Make that man clean that."  He turned and
went away abruptly.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs called the engine driver, a little man of
herculean build.  "I knowed he'd spot that," the
man said, in a tone of protest.  "Got a eye like a
hawk, he have."
</p>

<p>
It was the first time Carstairs had noticed this man
particularly; they had been on different shifts before.
He looked him over with approval; the arms, bare
to the elbow, were astonishingly big and sinewy-looking;
the chest was immensely deep, it arched
fully outward from the base of the full, white throat;
the top button of his shirt, left undone, showed a
glimpse of a very white skin and the commencement
of a tattoed picture ("Ajax defying his mother-in-law,"
the man called it); his eyes were a bright hazel
brown, singularly piercing and steady.
</p>

<p>
"What's your name?"
</p>

<p>
"Bounce, sir."  He stood up very straight, his
piercing eyes resting with steady persistence on
Carstairs' face.
</p>

<p>
The name seemed remarkably appropriate.  The
whole man was suggestive of indiarubber.
</p>

<p>
"Been a sailor or soldier, haven't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Sailor, sir.  I done twelve year in the navy."
</p>

<p>
"Did you?" Carstairs looked at him, thoughtfully.
"I've got an uncle in the navy."
</p>

<p>
"What name did you say, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
"Carstairs, I knows him.  Commander Carstairs.
I was with him in the 'Mediterranean.'  Nice bloke
he was.  You ask him if he remembers Bounce, sir,
Algernon Edward Bounce, A.B., light-weight champion
boxer of the Mediterranean Fleet.  He was there
when I won it at Malta."
</p>

<p>
The man's manner was exceedingly civil and
respectful, but there was something about it that kept
irresistibly before your mind all the time that he was
an independent unit, a man.  After twelve years of
the sternest discipline in the world this man was as
free as the air he breathed, there was no sign of
servility.  The thought passed through Carstairs'
mind, as he looked at him, that this breed, truly,
never could be slaves.
</p>

<p>
"I'll ask him when I see him.  So you're a boxer,
are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  Light weight, though I ought to go
middle; eleven stone two pounds, that's my weight.
I can get down to ten, but I ain't comfortable, though
I 'ave a done it."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs measured him with his eyes.  He seemed
very little over five feet.  Later on, he ascertained
that he was exactly five feet three inches.
</p>

<p>
"I see.  Just wipe over that brass work, will you?"
</p>

<p>
With remarkable alacrity, and a peculiarly prompt
and decisive manner, the man saluted and set about
his work.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs watched him in silence for some minutes,
struck more than ever by the appropriateness of his
name; he marvelled too at the singularity of his chief.
In all that clean and bright engine room there was
only that one bit of obscure brass work uncleaned,
and the chief had spotted it.  "An acutely observant
man, evidently," Carstairs meditated.
</p>

<p>
Later on in the evening, the chief assistant dropped
in.  He was a big, heavily-built man with a
well-shaped, massive head and handsome, even features
with general indication of great strength&mdash;mental,
moral, and physical; the sort of man many women
go into ecstasies over: the element of the brute
seemed fairly strong in him.  To Carstairs' critical
eyes and slow, careful scrutiny, he appeared, however,
somewhat flabby.  He stood behind Carstairs on the
switchboard and watched him parallel machines.
</p>

<p>
Now the process known as "paralleling" or
"synchronizing" alternating current dynamos or
"alternators" is somewhat critical; the operator
has to watch two voltmeters and get their reading
exactly alike; he also has to watch two lamps (now
usually supplanted by a small voltmeter) which grow
dull and bright more or less quickly, from perhaps
sixty times a minute to ten or twelve times per minute,
as the engine drivers slowly vary the speed of the
engines.  When the voltmeters are reading alike,
and during the small fraction of a minute when the
lamps are at their brightest, the operator has to close
a fairly ponderous switch; if he is too late or too
early, but particularly if he is too late, there are
unpleasant consequences: the machines groan and
shriek with an awe-inspiring sound, keeping it up very
often for a considerable time; all the lamps on the
system surge badly, and the needle of every instrument
on the switchboard does a little war dance on
its own, till the machines settle down.  Sometimes
the consequences of a "bad shot" are even more
dire.  There once appeared in one of the technical
journals a pathetic little poem about a pupil's "first
shot," how "he gazed severely at the voltmeters,"
and "looked sternly at the lamps," then he "took a
howler," and "switched out again," "wished he
hadn't," "Plugged in again and&mdash;bolted."  In a
similar journal there was another sort of prose poem,
too, written in mediæval English which finished up a
long tale of woe thus: "He taketh a flying shot and
shutteth down ye station."
</p>

<p>
This was the operation then (in which every man
needs all his wits and some more than they possess)
in which Carstairs was engaged at a critical period of
the load (for be it remembered the time available is
always strictly limited) when the chief assistant stood
behind him.  He remained calm and impassive, as
behoved his countenance, for some time, then, just
when the phases were beginning to get longer, and
Carstairs took hold of the switch handle in readiness
to plug in; the chief assistant stepped excitedly up
behind him.  "Now!  Be careful!  Watch your
volts!  There!  There!  You might have had that
one!  Look out, here she comes!  Watch your volts,
man, watch your volts!"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs felt like knocking him down, he missed
two good phases that he might have taken, then he
"plugged in" rather early.  The machines groaned
a little, but soon settled down.
</p>

<p>
"Too soon!  Too soon!" the chief assistant said,
</p>

<p>
In angry silence Carstairs turned and signalled the
engine driver to speed up the machine.  The chief
assistant left the board, and went out without further
comment.
</p>

<p>
"Does that ass always play the mountebank behind
a chap when he's paralleling?" Carstairs asked his
junior.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes, he gets fits now and again: Fitsgerald,
the chap that's just left, turned round and
cursed him one day.  I nearly fell off the board with
laughing.  Old Robinson looked at me.  'What the
devil are you laughing at?' he said.  I might have
got your job if it hadn't been for that.  Fitsgerald
got the sack over it."
</p>

<p>
"Apparently I shouldn't have missed much,"
Carstairs said as he went away.
</p>

<p>
When he got home at about half-past twelve,
Darwen was sitting up for him.  "How did you get
on?" he asked, with his genial smile.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, first-class."  They sat down to supper.
"Took rather a howler, paralleling six and seven.
That ass Robinson was jigging about like a
monkey-on-stick behind me, telling me what to do.  Next
time I shall stand aside and ask if he'd prefer to do it
himself."
</p>

<p>
"Don't do that, old chap, he's a malice-bearing
beast.  Funks always are!  Don't take any notice of
him.  Forget him, or send him away; ask if he'd
mind watching the drivers, as they brought her down
too quick, or something, last time."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was silent.
</p>

<p>
"Fitsgerald got the sack for cursing him over
the same thing.  He was a red-headed chap.  We
were talking about Robinson's unpleasant ways (he'd
had a go at me the day before).  I said he wanted
a good cursing to cure him of it, and I'm blowed if
Fitz didn't curse him about a couple of days
later."  Darwen's eyes seemed to flicker with an uncanny
sort of light, his voice dropped into a reflective tone.
"Threatened to chuck him over the handrail if he
didn't go off the switchboard.  Hasty chaps those
red-headed fellows are.  We had a chap at school&mdash;what
school were you at, Carstairs?"
</p>

<p>
"Cheltenham."
</p>

<p>
"Were you?  I was at Clifton, went to Faraday
House, after."
</p>

<p>
Pushing back his chair, Darwen, got up and went
to the piano, he played some very slow, soft music,
slow and soothing, it breathed the breath of peace
into Carstairs' troubled soul.
</p>

<p>
"Robinson is only a fool," Darwen said over his
shoulder.  "I feel rather sorry for him&mdash;hasn't got
the heart of a mouse&mdash;gets in a frightful stew when
he's got to parallel himself&mdash;he's not a bad-hearted
chap&mdash;done me one or two rather good turns."
</p>

<p>
"I thought he was alright too, at other times."
Carstairs felt the spirit of peace stirring within him.
</p>

<p>
"It's kinder to him to let him drift, he doesn't
mean anything&mdash;can't help himself&mdash;nervous, you
know.  I just smile at him."
</p>

<p>
"Suppose that is the best way.  I'll have a shot
next time, anyway.  Made me rather ratty to-night."
</p>

<p>
Darwen played for some time in silence.  "Chief
come in at all?" he asked, at length.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Came in and groused about a bit of brass
work being dirty."
</p>

<p>
"That's like the chief.  He'll never express an
opinion on anything except its external appearance;
very safe man, the chief, extremely safe, but stupid:
he'll fail, not through what he does, but what he leaves
undone."  He ceased speaking, but the music went
on slowly welling out, breathing good will and trust
to all mankind.  It died slowly away leaving the tired
listener in a blissful state of rest.  Darwen got up
and looked at him with sparkling, observant eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night, old chap.  I'm going to bed."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs arose slowly from the big, easy chair,
"Wish I could play like you, Darwen."
</p>

<p>
The rest of the week passed (at the works) with
singular uneventfulness, in fact never afterwards did
Carstairs have such an uneventful week on load shift;
but all the same the memory of his first week on shift
by himself remained always clear and distinct above
all other experiences; never afterwards did he feel
the delightful thrill of responsibility, of excitement, of
awe almost, as he walked round the engine room and
boiler house surveying the men and plant, for those
first few days, and felt that for eight hours he was
monarch of all he surveyed; with all the other men
far out of call, spreading out in different parts of the
town, reading their papers, at the theatre or music
halls, while he was responsible for the lightening of
their darkness, and the safe keeping of the men and
plant around him.  In after life he often reflected
that the princely salary of £104 per annum was
singularly inadequate for the kingly nature of his
office; but the greengrocers, the doctors, and publicans
thought it was remarkably good for a man who spent
most of his time walking about with his hands in his
pockets.  These works had been making a financial
loss of from £100 to £2000 every year since they
started, with the exception of one year, when, by careful
manipulation of the accounts, they managed to show
a profit of £20, which, under the expert examination
of a proper accountant, would probably have been
converted to a loss of £500.
</p>

<p>
Darwen watched the finances with a keen interest.
He was very chummy with Robinson; they studied
the reports of the various stations together with great
earnestness.  "A loss or a profit doesn't matter
much to a corporation as long as they have
continuity of supply."  Darwen laid it down as a law,
and Robinson heartily agreed.  That axiom was only
a half truth, but the foundation of all municipal
work is only a half truth, so it did not matter much.
</p>

<p>
Robinson was very proud.  "We never have the
lights out here," he said.  And Darwen smiled
approval.  "That's so," he agreed, and on his shift
he took care that it always should be so; he had every
engine in the place warmed up, ready for instant use,
and two boilers always lighted up and under pressure
in case of necessity.  Robinson approved of his
method, and the chief&mdash;the chief grumbled about the
boiler house being dirty, but on Darwen's shift it
was cleaner and more tidy than on any other shift;
also the engine room was brighter and more spotless,
so much and so persistently so, in fact, that the
cautious chief was drawn out of his shell to express
a decided opinion to the chairman of the electricity
committee (who remarked on it).  "Yes," the chief
said, with a little flicker of enthusiasm, "that man
Darwen is decidedly the best engineer I've ever
had."  Which remark was not overlooked by the chairman,
a doctor, a large man with a large imposing black
beard, who had been struck, as who could fail to be,
by the remarkable beauty of face and form and general
impression of intelligence of the athletic young
engineer.
</p>

<p>
It was not very long after Darwen had observed
the chief and chairman in conversation and looking
pointedly at him, that he developed certain symptoms
which, in his opinion, necessitated medical advice.
Common sense, he explained to Carstairs, pointed
out the chairman as the man to go to.
</p>

<p>
The doctor recognized him at once.  "Hullo!"
he said, looking him over with distinct approval,
for Darwen's winning, frank smile captivated him
at once.  "Has the electricity got on your
system?"  The doctor was a jovial, hearty man.
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed.  He showed precisely the right
amount of amusement at the joke, then, shortly and
precisely, he stated (almost verbatim from a medical
book he had looked up in the reference library) the
symptoms of a more or less minor complaint.
</p>

<p>
Recognizing it at once, "I'll soon put that right
for you," the doctor said, in his hearty, jovial way.
His extensive practice was largely due to his jovial
manner; he appreciated the clear and precise
statement of the symptoms.
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing serious then, doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!&mdash;no!  It might have been, of course,
if you'd let it go on."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that's just it; it's the same with an engine,
you know, 'a stitch in time.'  I like to get expert
advice at the start."
</p>

<p>
This was business from the doctor's point of view.
He became serious.  "Most true," he said.  "Still,
people will aggravate their complaints by so-called
home treatments."
</p>

<p>
"The penny-wise policy, doctor, the results of
combined ignorance and meanness."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder," Darwen said, later on, as he poured
the contents of a medicine bottle down the bathroom
waste pipe, "I wonder what in thunder this is,
a sort of elixir of life served out to most people for
most complaints at a varying price.  Funny what
stuff people will pour down their necks."
</p>

<p>
Some hours later, as they sat facing each other in
their big easy chairs, Darwen said: "Didn't you say
your guv'nor was a parson, Carstairs?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Because the time has arrived to trot him out."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?"  Carstairs flushed rather
angrily.
</p>

<p>
"I have not got a guv'nor," Darwen observed,
sadly; "haven't any recollection of my guv'nor.
He went down with the Peninsula coming home
from Australia.  He was a mining engineer."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was softened.  "Hard lines," he said,
and there was much sympathy in his tone.
</p>

<p>
"It is," Darwen agreed.  "A guv'nor helps one so
much.  I want you to get your guv'nor to come down
and stay with us for a few days.  What College was
he at?"
</p>

<p>
"Christ Church, Oxford."
</p>

<p>
"Then it's almost a cert he'll bump up against some
one he knows down here, some other parson, or
somebody.  I want to get into the chairman's crowd,
he's churchwarden at St James'.  I'm going there."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs removed his pipe slowly from his lips
and stared more or less blankly.  It was the limit
of surprise he allowed himself ever to express.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and I'm joining St James' Gym. and the
Conservative Club.  Robinson has introduced me to
one or two rather decent people, too; Robinson belongs
here, you know.  To-morrow you and I are going
to sign on for a dancing class; Robinson's people
put me on to it; Robinson doesn't dance.  I'm pretty
good, and you'll be good with practice.  Every fit
man can dance well with practice."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs puffed silently at his pipe for some minutes.
"Will the dividends on dancing, gymnastics, church-going,
etc., pan out better than working?" he asked
at length.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think you are getting the full value of your
present stock of knowledge?"
</p>

<p>
"Not by chalks, but one never does."
</p>

<p>
"I beg to differ; some men get paid considerably
over the value of their knowledge."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you're correct," Carstairs admitted, after
a pause.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I want to join the happy band.  Shove
your knowledge forward, having due regard to the
manner of your doing so, that it does not defeat its
own ends.  And that is wisdom; you're paid for the
combined product of your knowledge and your
wisdom.  Wisdom is the most scarce, the most
valuable, and the most difficult to acquire: it is
the knowledge of the use of knowledge.  Do you see?"
</p>

<p>
"They bear the relation to each other of theory
and practice in engineering."
</p>

<p>
"Not quite.  Theory is an effort of the imagination,
either a spontaneous effort of your own, based on
known facts, or an assimilation of the results of other
men's practice as recorded by them in books.  The
sources of error are twofold; the limits of your own
imagination, your own conception of the other man's
description, and the limit of the other man's gift of
expression and explanation.  Practice is your own
conception and remembrance of what you yourself
have personally experienced.  Both are knowledge;
wisdom is distinct from either."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs smiled.  "Well, it's your wisdom I doubt,
not your knowledge.  I mean to say, that my application
of my knowledge to my conception of your
application of your knowledge, as expressed by you
in the present discussion, leads me to doubt the
accuracy of your application of your knowledge to
the case under discussion.  The possible sources of
error being in my imagination or your expression,
and as my imagination is a fixed quantity, unless you
can improve your expression, I shall fail to coincide
with you.  How's that?"
</p>

<p>
"That's very good."  Darwen took a deep breath
and laughed.  "Let me have another shot.  Who
gets the most money, the successful professor or the
successful business man?"
</p>

<p>
"The successful business man."
</p>

<p>
"Hear, hear!  That's because he's selling wisdom,
while the professor is selling knowledge."
</p>

<p>
"I disagree, on two points.  Number one, the
business man sells necessities, boots for instance;
the professor sells luxuries, quaternions, for
instance."  Carstairs paused and quoted, "'What I like about
quaternions, sir, is that they can't be put to any base
utilitarian purpose.'"
</p>

<p>
"Quaternions, my dear chap&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Half a minute!  Number two, the business man
sells knowledge of men and affairs as opposed to the
professor's knowledge of things only."
</p>

<p>
"The Lord has delivered you into my hands, Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
"I saw it as soon as I'd spoken."
</p>

<p>
"Well, let us acquire knowledge of men and affairs,
instead of merely of things&mdash;engines."
</p>

<p>
"I admit that my conception of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Chuck it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you've made a good point."
</p>

<p>
"You're Harveyized steel, Carstairs, and it gives
me immense satisfaction to see that I'm making
some impression on you.  Well, you may go on grinding
away all your life, and if nobody knows of the
knowledge you possess, you'll never get paid for it."
</p>

<p>
"But I will show it by the application of it in my
work.  The chief is bound to see it."
</p>

<p>
"Not a ha'porth, my boy.  And if he does, the
chances are that he'll depreciate it in the eyes of the
world, or get you the sack, because he'll be afraid
of you."
</p>

<p>
"I admit the probability of those possibilities."
</p>

<p>
"As an engineer you must never forget the
interdependence of parts: as a successful man you must
never overlook the interdependence of everything
in nature.  Smile at men as if you were overjoyed
to see them and they'll give you anything, as long as
it's not their own property."
</p>

<p>
"Hear, hear!"
</p>

<p>
"Our object in life is to persuade the councillors
to dole us out an extra dose of the ratepayers'
money."
</p>

<p>
"I admit the correctness of the conclusion."
</p>

<p>
"Then let us, with all circumspection, smile on
the councillors and their wives and daughters,
particularly the daughters."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing would please me more, provided the
daughters reciprocate the smile."
</p>

<p>
"They'll do that alright, old chap, if you only do
it the right way.  The most potent force in nature
is the love of women; it behoves us as engineers to
utilize this force.  There is nothing much that a
woman in love won't do, and there is even less that
she won't make the poor fool, who imagines she is in
love with him, do."
</p>

<p>
"It's supposed to be specially dangerous to run
two girls in parallel."
</p>

<p>
"You may take it as proved that, 'In the same town
and on the same side of it, there cannot be two girls
in love with the same man, etc.'  All the same, the
idea of it is rather fascinating."  Darwen's eyes
sparkled.
</p>

<p>
"We are wandering from the point."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so.  Are you going to get your guv'nor down?"
</p>

<p>
"Look here.  Have you got any money?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm not absolutely stony."
</p>

<p>
"Then lend me two quid and I'll go home for a
week-end and bring him back."
</p>

<p>
Darwen fished out his purse with a smile.  "The
seeds of wisdom are in you, I perceive," he said.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the strains of music were wafted in to
them through the open window.  "What in thunder
is that?" Darwen asked, getting up with a puzzled
look and gazing out into the street.  "By Jove,
it's a kid with a mouth organ, looks like a gipsy kid."
</p>

<p>
With a serious face Carstairs got up and looked
out of the window too.  The boy was looking directly
up at the window; as soon as he caught sight of
Carstairs, he changed his tune abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"What's that tune, Darwen?  I seem to know it."
</p>

<p>
"That's 'The Gipsy's Warning.'  The kid plays
very well, too, for an instrument like that.  I thought
it was a violin for a minute."
</p>

<p>
They stood up at the window and watched.  The
boy played the same thing twice over, then he played
a Scotch tune.  Then he opened the gate and walking
across the little lawn stood under the window and
touched his cap.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs put his hand in his pocket and pulled
out sixpence.  "Wait a minute," he said to the boy.
He went downstairs and spoke to him.  "Do you
come from Scotland?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; I seen you there.  Sam's down here and
he's after you."  He turned and went out into the
road again and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs looked after him with a troubled frown,
then he returned to the sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
Darwen looked at him with observant, surprised
eyes.  "Did you know that kid?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, but he knew me.  I once had a row with a
gipsy in Scotland; flattened him out, broke his leg;
he's been after me ever since.  That kid came to tell
me he's in this town now.  Next pay day I shall
invest in a young bull dog."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs sat down again in the big easy chair and
gazed at nothing.  His thoughts were far away;
he had no doubt who had sent the gipsy boy to warn
him.  "The most potent force, the love of women."  Good
God! and what of the love of men?  A gipsy
girl.  It was quite impossible.
</p>

<p>
Then Darwen played&mdash;pleading, soothing music&mdash;and
Carstairs told him the whole story.
</p>

<p>
"You'll have to remove that gipsy, that Sam&mdash;in
self-defence, mind, of course.  And the girl&mdash;you
couldn't marry a gipsy, of course, but it's not
necessary."
</p>

<p>
And Carstairs listened in silence.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<p>
Time passed, and although Carstairs kept a good
look out, he saw nothing of Sam, the gipsy;
he bought a substantial ash walking stick which he
kept constantly by him.  On the night shift he
tackled Bounce, the ex-sailor.  "Can you fence?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, I'm very good at fencing."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs smiled, but he knew all the same that it
was a simple statement of the truth without any
affected modesty or blatant boasting.  "I'll bring
down a couple of sticks, and you can give me a little
instruction if you will."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be very pleased, sir."
</p>

<p>
He had a manner all his own of making even this
simple statement; it suggested an equality of manhood
while admitting an inferiority of station; every
word and action showed a confident, self-contained,
self-respecting man.
</p>

<p>
So in the wee sma' hours of the morning, when everyone
else was in bed, Carstairs and Bounce fenced with
single sticks in a clear space in the engine room.
They got very chummy over these contests.  Carstairs
had frequently had long yarns with Bounce before
in the quietness of the night watch, but now as
they smote each other good and hard (for they wore
neither helmets, jackets, nor aprons) and Carstairs
smiled and Bounce grinned like a merry imp, and
occasionally apologized for an "extra stiff un," they
seemed to draw very close together, so much so, that
one night Carstairs told him the tale of Sam the
gipsy.
</p>

<p>
Bounce shook his head seriously.  "Gipsies is
nasty blokes," he observed, pondering deeply.
"Some good fighting men amongst 'em, too."  He
pondered again.  "I should think now that a bit of
boxing would be more useful to you than fencing.
Or&mdash;have you got a pistol?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and a set of gloves.  I'll bring them both
down to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
Next night Bounce's eyes scintillated light as he
fingered the well-made brown leather boxing gloves,
and examined the beautiful little American target
revolver.  "This is fancy," he said, in regard to the
latter.  "It wouldn't stop a man, though."
</p>

<p>
"Depends where you hit him," suggested Carstairs.
</p>

<p>
"That's true, sir."
</p>

<p>
They retired to a secluded corner of the boiler
house, and Bounce fastened a piece of board on the
wall and stuck three tin tacks in it, then he drew
back as far as the dimensions of the place would
admit, which was about fifteen yards.  "Shall I
have first shot, sir?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs handed him the revolver, and then a
box of cartridges.  He loaded, then raised his arm,
and, taking a fairly long sight at the board, fired.
"That's a miss," he observed.  "I'll get a bit of
chalk."
</p>

<p>
Stepping up to the board, Carstairs saw that he
had missed the head of a tin tack by about a sixteenth
of an inch.
</p>

<p>
Bounce returned from the engine room with a piece
of chalk and whitened over the heads of the tin tacks.
"I ain't had a shot with a revolver for two years, or
more," he observed, apologetically.  Then he took
another shot and burst the head of one tin tack;
his next shot bent the second tin tack over on one side.
The third shot drove the remaining tack right home.
"There you are, sir," he said, with some pride,
handing Carstairs the revolver.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Bounce!  Is there anything much
in the way of offence and defence that you can't
do?" Carstairs asked with open admiration.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I don't think there is very much, sir.  I've
fired everything up to a six-inch gun, over that I
ain't quite sure.  Mind, I have afired a twelve-inch,
but I ain't quite sure.  A twelve-inch takes some
handling, see."  He stood up very straight, looking
Carstairs steadily in the eyes as he made this simple
statement.
</p>

<p>
Then they boxed, and the applicability of his
surname struck Carstairs more than ever; he seemed
literally to bounce out of the way, just when Carstairs
was going to hit him, and he bounced in again with
singular directness and precision immediately
Carstairs had missed him.  Every night for the rest of
the week they boxed for half an hour at a time,
and Carstairs, with his clear head and steady nerves,
soon began to make progress.
</p>

<p>
"What you wants, principally, is to hit hard, an'
quick an' straight."  Bounce laid it down as a law,
and suiting his own actions accordingly, he bounced
in and hit Carstairs in the eye, so that it afterwards
turned a lively shade of deep, blue-black.
</p>

<p>
Bounce apologized, then he grinned like a healthy
fiend.  "It do show up," he observed, "but a black
eye ain't near so painful as a good un on the nose."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs smiled too.  "Oh! it doesn't matter in
the least," he said.  "It's part of the game.
Unfortunately I'm going home to see my people
to-morrow."  He gazed at it thoughtfully in the
looking-glass in the lavatory.  "The guv'nor'll understand,
but the mater&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I knows, sir."
</p>

<p>
Next day Carstairs went home to the little vicarage
of Chilcombe, and on his way to the station he caught
sight of a rough-looking man in well-worn gaiters,
a fur cap and a heavy coat with big poacher's pockets,
limping down a side street.  Carstairs felt angry.
"That's the swine," he said, to himself.  Then a
sudden surge of pity overwhelmed him.  "Poor
devil! he does limp."
</p>

<p>
He got a seat in the corner of an empty third-class
carriage and opened a paper he had purchased, but
he did not read, he thought of the rough-looking man
with the limp, of the beautiful girl in Scotland and
Darwen&mdash;the three seemed inextricably mixed up,
somehow.  "Darwen's a skunk," he said, but that was
the only definite conclusion at which he could arrive.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the train hurried him homewards, and
very soon he arrived at the main line junction, and
changed into the crawling local.  He had written
to say which train he would arrive by, and as the train
drew up at the pretty country station, he saw the
tall, black-garbed figure of his father on the platform.
They shook hands solemnly, and eyes so much like
his own beamed approval and pleasure as the strong
brown cricketer's hand gripped his.  Suddenly they
sobered down into a look half amusement, half pain,
as they rested on the discoloured skin (by careful
doctoring reduced to a bright yellow) round his eye.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with the eye, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's boxing."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  It was a sigh of relief and distinct
approval.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; a man at the works, engine driver, you know,
ex-sailor, light-weight champion of the Mediterranean
Fleet, he's coaching me."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, very good, excellent sport.  Suppose you
don't lose your temper?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!  Not with Bounce."  He laughed.
"How's the mater and all the rest of them?"
</p>

<p>
"Your mother's very well, very well indeed.
Phillip is going on very well in India."
</p>

<p>
"Got a rise yet?"
</p>

<p>
"Rise?&mdash;er&mdash;no.  In fact, you're doing the best
of any, so far.  Mrs Bevengton was inquiring about
you; she and Bessie are coming over to tea to-morrow."  He
shot a sudden, keen glance at his son.  "Very nice
girl, Bessie, extremely nice."
</p>

<p>
"That's so," Jack admitted.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen anything more of your gipsy
maiden?"  There was a note of anxiety in his
father's voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; seen her once for a few minutes."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  It seemed as if Jack had explained something,
some obscure point.
</p>

<p>
"Her fancy man flattened me out."
</p>

<p>
"Flattened you out?"
</p>

<p>
"Hit me on the back of the head with a stick."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing very serious, I suppose; still it's a pity
you got mixed up with those people."
</p>

<p>
"Yes; the girl came down next night with another
stick to flatten out her fancy man."  Unconsciously
there was a note of pride in Jack's voice.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me, what terrible people!  It's a very great
pity you got mixed up with them at all&mdash;a very
great pity."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it is a pity," Jack agreed.  He seemed so
pensive that his father regarded him in some concern.
</p>

<p>
"Many young men entirely wreck their lives by
these youthful entanglements," he said.  "Those
sort of girls, who appear beautiful and fascinating
at your age, usually strike one as coarse and outré
a few years later."
</p>

<p>
"That's very possible," Jack admitted, and he
smiled as though a weight had been lifted off his
mind.
</p>

<p>
They turned in at the big double gates.
</p>

<p>
"By the way, there is&mdash;er&mdash;no necessity to mention
that little affair to your mother.  Women brood over
these things, and build up all sorts of vague horrors
and possibilities of their own."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," Jack admitted, very soberly, so that
his father glanced quickly at him again.  But they
were at the house and there was no time for further
questioning.
</p>

<p>
Jack's mother noticed his discoloured eye at once.
"Oh, Jack, whatever have you been doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Only boxing, mother."
</p>

<p>
"I wish you'd be more careful; you're so violent.
I'm sure cricket and lawn tennis are much nicer."
</p>

<p>
"They're nice enough, mater, but not nearly so
useful."
</p>

<p>
There was a seriousness in the way he said it that
made both father and mother look at him sharply.
"Useful?"
</p>

<p>
He smiled, his calm, easy smile.  "I mean to say,
stokers and so on sometimes get abusive, you know,
and in the interests of real peace it is best to know
how to flatten 'em out if necessary."
</p>

<p>
"I wish Jack, you wouldn't use such slangy
expressions."
</p>

<p>
"Very sorry, mater."
</p>

<p>
But his father's keen, blue eyes continued to watch
him steadily, and after Mrs Carstairs had gone to
bed, he stayed down for half an hour chatting with his
son.  "I suppose," he said, "there is no possibility
of those gipsies molesting you further?"
</p>

<p>
Jack shrugged his shoulders.  "Can't say," he
drawled.  "I left them in Scotland."
</p>

<p>
"They wander, these people, you know."
</p>

<p>
"That's true; however, there is always the police,
you know."  Jack was very unconcerned.  "By
the way, guv'nor, could you come back and stay with
me for a few days?  Another fellow and myself
are digging together, you know.  He's a jolly decent
sort; opens his mouth rather wide at times, says more
than he means, you know, but he's a good sort.  Got
me my job, as a matter of fact.  He wants you to
come too.  Wants to get to know some decent
people; he's a dancing man and that sort of thing.
Thinks you'll probably bump up against some one you
know, give us a lift in our jobs besides making
things more pleasant.  You understand."
</p>

<p>
The Reverend Carstairs' shrewd eyes twinkled
merrily.  "You want to utilize your old father, eh?
What about this young man's father?"
</p>

<p>
"He hasn't got one; drowned at sea when he was
a kid."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  The grey eyes softened into sympathy
at once.  "Of course I'll come.  It's quite the right
view to take; young men cast adrift in a strange
town usually get acquainted with quite the wrong
people.  Southville?  Southville?  Ah, yes.  I think
the vicar of St James' there is an old Christ Church
man.  Let me see."  He got up and reached down
a book of reference.  "Here we are.  Southville,
St James.  Yes!  Moorhouse.  Ah!  I thought so.
He was not exactly a chum, but a friend.  I've no
doubt he'll be pleased to see me.  What is your
friend like?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, about the same as myself, but exceedingly
handsome, striking, you know.  Sort of chap you turn
round to look at.  Very dark, almost Italian looking."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  You ought to be able to make things very
pleasant for yourselves down there.  I'll go back
with you on Monday."  His father stood up.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks very much.  Shall I turn out the light?"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, if you will.  Good night."
</p>

<p>
So Jack turned in once more in the old familiar
bed in the old familiar room at the corner of the
house, with windows overlooking a wide sweep of the
rolling Cotswold Hills.
</p>

<p>
Next morning after church he met Mrs Bevengton
and Bessie; she coloured slightly as she shook hands
with him, and her dimples sprang into prominent
evidence in a smile that expressed more than pleasure.
</p>

<p>
Jack regarded her thoughtfully, with very great
pleasure too.  She seemed the personification of
beauty, not so much in the physical as the moral
sense; as he walked by her side slowly down the
brown-gravel path in the warm light of an autumn sun,
countless little incidents of his childhood's days
returned to him, bearing a fuller and a newer meaning;
this girl had always been clean, clean as it is
understood in England, honest and unspiteful, she never
cheated.  When he parted at the gate it was with a
distinct sense of pleasure that he was to meet her
again in the afternoon.  She laughed, a jolly, happy
laugh, when he explained the discolouration of his eye.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Carstairs and Mrs Bevengton coming behind
had observed them with mutual approval: "Don't
you think Bessie's improved?"  Jack's mother said
to him as they walked home together.
</p>

<p>
"She's better looking if that's what you mean,
otherwise she was always a jolly decent girl."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there are not many girls like her."
</p>

<p>
"In that, mater, your opinion should be of
considerably more value than mine, I haven't met very
many girls."
</p>

<p>
"You're getting old enough to think about these
things now."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mater, to <i>think</i> about them."
</p>

<p>
About three o'clock in the afternoon, Dr and Mrs
Bevengton and Bessie arrived.  After half an hour's
exchange of family greetings, Jack and Bessie went
out into the garden, leaving the old people indoors.
</p>

<p>
"Shall we go for a stroll through Cleeve woods?"
Jack asked, presently.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I haven't been there for a long time."
</p>

<p>
Cleeve woods were the private property of Lady
Cleeve, but Jack and Bessie were privileged persons,
allowed to trespass whenever they liked.  They
wandered along the well-known paths, going very
slowly; every tree and bush held its own secret for
them, recalling each its own little tragedy or comedy
of their early lives.
</p>

<p>
Bessie stopped in front of a tall pine tree.  "Do
you remember when you climbed up there and took
the kestrel's eggs?"
</p>

<p>
"I remember curly-haired 'Fatty,' and Jim down
below keeping 'cave,' in case the keeper came."
</p>

<p>
The dimples burst out anew.  "I was a fatty then,
wasn't I?  You came down all the way without a
word.  I knew you'd got eggs by the careful way you
were watching your pockets.  I thought it was only
a magpie's, then you glanced round like a burglar
and just showed one eye over the top of your pocket,
I knew it was a hawk's because it was red."
</p>

<p>
"A kestrel is a falcon, Bessie, not a hawk.  You
said, 'O-oh,' under your breath, and Jim whispered
'what is it?'  Jim never could tell one egg from
another."
</p>

<p>
"We all felt like desperate poachers and crept out
of the wood in breathless haste, and you blew them
under the chestnut tree on your lawn."
</p>

<p>
Jack looked at her with a sudden admiration.
</p>

<p>
"You were always a pal and full of pluck," he said.
"When I was up old Giles' apple tree and he came
out with his dog, Jim bolted like a rabbit, but you
stayed behind like a brick and waited for me."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I remember, my knees were knocking
together with fright."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you crammer, you threw an apple at the dog."
</p>

<p>
Bessie laughed.  "Old Giles was a good sort.  He
knew who we were right enough, but he never told
father."
</p>

<p>
Talking thus they strolled on till they came out on
the trimmed laurels and well-kept lawn that surrounded
Lady Cleeve's house.  Jack stopped.  "I expect the
footman will come out and ask impertinent questions
if we go over the lawn, won't he?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no! he knows me very well."
</p>

<p>
Still they stopped for some time admiring the house
and the well-kept grounds.  It was just getting dusk
and lights were already beginning to appear in some
of the windows of the big old house.  "I should
like to own a place like this some day," Jack said.
He stepped on to the lawn.  "By Jove! these lawns
are grand, aren't they?  Do you remember that time
I was on holidays from Cheltenham, when they gave a
sort of tea fight to the whole village?  And the
yokels were playing kiss-in-ring on the lawn?"
</p>

<p>
Bessie coloured a good red and looked down at
the smooth carpet-like grass, poking aimlessly with
the point of her umbrella.  They were fairly close
to the house.  Suddenly one of the near windows
sprang into a glare of light, showing up everything
within with great distinctness.  A female servant,
in cap and apron, was lighting the gas.  Her profile
showed clear and distinct against the light.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! there's that new maid who's just come to
the Hall.  Don't you think she's remarkably
handsome, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs looked up, the girl in the room turned,
so that the light was full on her face, and every feature
was distinct: the blood seemed to bound in his veins,
he was astonished at the thrill he felt.
</p>

<p>
It was some seconds, perhaps a minute, before he
answered, then it was a very slow drawl.  "Yes,
exceedingly handsome."
</p>

<p>
Then they went home almost in silence, for Carstairs
had recognized in Lady Cleeve's new housemaid,
his gipsy girl from Scotland.

<h3>
CHAPTER X
</h3>

<p>
Early on the Monday morning the Reverend
Hugh and his son Jack entrained for Southville.
Jack was pre-occupied with some deep
thought, and his father noticed it.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry to leave the old place, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;yes.  Nothing touches this place for me."
</p>

<p>
"You must get to know some nice people at Southville."
</p>

<p>
Jack pulled himself together; he had been gazing
earnestly at Lady Cleeve's house nestling in among
the pine trees; the slope of a hill suddenly shut out
the view, and Jack turned to his father with attention
undivided.  "You know I'm not so keen on the people
as the work, but Darwen seems to think that in
municipal work you can't get on at all without friends."
</p>

<p>
The parson's eyes lighted up with approval as he
listened to his son.  "Work is the thing that makes
life enjoyable, but you must have friends, you know."
</p>

<p>
Jack was silent for some time.  "It seems a rotten
state of things," he observed at length, and his father
laughed aloud.
</p>

<p>
Darwen was on shift when they arrived, but Jack
took his father to their diggings, and very soon after
Darwen came in; his handsome face lighted up with
a beaming smile as he shook hands with the Reverend
Hugh.  "I say," he said, "I should have known
you for Jack's father if I had met you in the street
alone."
</p>

<p>
The old parson smiled with approval as his shrewd
grey eyes took in a complete impression of face and
form and expression.  He succumbed at once to the
charming manner and charming personality of the
tall, clean-looking young engineer.  "Wholesome,
athletic, happy-go-lucky, but intelligent," was his
mental summing up.  Such were the sort of friends
he expected his son to make; he looked from one to
the other with keen approval.  They pushed forward
the easiest chair and plied him with cushions and
tobacco.  They took him back to his own college
days.
</p>

<p>
"You fellows seem very comfortable here," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Not bad," they agreed.
</p>

<p>
He smiled.  "It was always 'not bad,'" he said.
"Hullo!" he glanced along the backs of the books
on the shelf at his side.  "Tennyson, Keats, Dante,
Shelley, 'Hamlet,' 'Julius Cæsar,' 'Barrack Room
Ballads,' 'The Prince'!  I didn't know you had a
fancy for poetry, Jack."
</p>

<p>
"Not guilty!  Those are Darwen's."  Jack was
stretched out, six feet of muscularity, full length on a
slender-looking couch.  He puffed slowly at his pipe.
"Those are mine"&mdash;he pointed to a shelf on the other
side.
</p>

<p>
His father glanced along the backs of them, reading
the names aloud.  "'Dynamo, Electric Machinery,'
h-m, bulky volume that!  'Manual of the Steam
Engine'; 'The Steam Engine,' h-m, three volumes.
'Polyphase Currents,' ah!  'Text Book of Heat,'
'Theoretical Chemistry,' 'Trigonometry,' 'Integral
Calculus,' 'Differential Calculus' (Todhunter).  That's
mine, I think.  I thought Edwards was the man on the
Calculus nowadays."
</p>

<p>
"Ye-es, Darwen's got him somewhere.  I prefer
Todhunter, leaves more to the imagination, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, the imagination.  Quite so."
</p>

<p>
"Seems to me the limit of a man's possibility in
anything is the limit of his imagination."
</p>

<p>
"And his control of it, Jack."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly."
</p>

<p>
Darwen had his chair tilted back wards, blowing clouds
of smoke vertically upwards to the ceiling.  He spoke
slowly between the puffs.  "Carstairs&mdash;Jack, has got
no soul above machines, inanimate lumps of iron; the
hum of a smoothly running engine is the only poetry
that appeals to him, so it does to me, but I like a change;
little bits of Shelley, little drops of Kipling&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I admit that 'M'Andrews' Hymn' is a real poem."
</p>

<p>
"Shut up!  You reek of the engine room.  I like
a change.  Variety is the soul of amusement."  He
dropped his chair on to its front legs again and looked
at Jack's father.  "Hasn't some one said that?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I really couldn't say, perhaps so."  He smiled
with amusement.
</p>

<p>
Darwen looked at him steadily, thoughtfully, for a
moment.  "Do you know I think there's a touch of
the Dago in me&mdash;or perhaps it's Celt.  Do you think
I'm Irish?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear boy, you should know that best."
</p>

<p>
"That's so!  English, the mater says, pure English,
but I don't know.  I'm a bit of a rogue, you know;
the instinct of dishonesty is very strong at times."
</p>

<p>
The Reverend Hugh laughed, and Darwen jumped
up.  "I'll play you a tune, if you'll stand it," he said.
He sat down and played, wandering on from one thing
to another, ever and anon glancing at the old vicar,
then he got up.  "Does that bore you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Bore me?  My dear fellow, you are an accomplished
musician."
</p>

<p>
He flushed slightly with pleasure.  "I like music.
Let's have a trot round the town and show your
guv'nor the sights, Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
"The guv'nor knows the vicar of St James."
</p>

<p>
"Does he?  By Jove! that's good."
</p>

<p>
So they went avisiting.
</p>

<p>
The Reverend Moorhouse was short and very broad,
he had more the legal than the clerical type of face;
an old international Rugby footballer, the impress
of the game was still strong on him, vigorous, keen,
bluff.  It was evident he was pleased to see his old
friend, he said so, and invited all three of them to
dinner the next night.
</p>

<p>
The dinner was good; Mrs Moorhouse was plain,
stout, chatty, and exceedingly kind; the Misses
Moorhouse, two of them, were tall, athletic, and pretty.
They talked about hockey and tennis and swimming;
the two young men were charmed.  Carstairs was
quite vivacious, Darwen seemed to scintillate; Mrs
Moorhouse watched him with approving eyes, and
later on, when he played and sang with the elder
Miss Moorhouse, she took possession of him; crossing
the room she sat down beside him.  "You must
come and help us at the church," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be delighted," he answered, with real
pleasure shining in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
The vicar's wife was business-like and decisive, she
fastened him down by compact and contract at once.
</p>

<p>
Altogether it was a merry and delightful evening,
and when they at length departed it was in a
particularly bright and happy mood.  They walked
back; it was not very far and a beautiful starry night;
there was a tinge of frost in the air; Jack Carstairs
threw his chest out and took a deep gulp of the fresh,
crisp air.
</p>

<p>
"I believe these little diversions do improve one's
form, you know, I feel like a sprint."  He looked up
and down the long silent street of semi-detached,
shrubbery-enclosed villas.  As he looked back his
face suddenly hardened into a fierce look of anger,
his mouth shut like a steel trap, and his grey eyes took
on a cold, steely glitter; for just as he glanced round,
a rough-looking man, carrying a big stick had limped
past a lamp light on the other side of the road.
Carstairs said no word, but there was an abruptness
in his manner that attracted his father's
attention.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter, Jack?"  He glanced round
and Darwen followed suit, but the man was now in
the shade and hardly noticeable.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," he answered, staring straight ahead;
but out of the corner of his eye he caught a meaning
look from Darwen, and in response jerked his head
ever so slightly backwards and to one side.
</p>

<p>
Promptly Darwen dropped back to do up his bootlace.
A few seconds later, the man with the limp,
who had crossed the road and was now directly
behind them, quickened his pace and limped past.
Carstairs stopped and faced round as the limping step
drew near, but the man's face was averted and he went
on without a word or sign; some way ahead they saw
that he was joined by another man, hitherto
unobserved, who, without any word of greeting, stepped
out of the shadow and walked along with him; he
seemed exceptionally short, but his hands hung down
below his knees&mdash;probably a hunchback.
</p>

<p>
"Those men are after no good," the Reverend Hugh
observed.
</p>

<p>
"No.  I expect not.  There have been several
burglaries round here lately."
</p>

<p>
Darwen held out his walking-stick.  "Do you
notice the sticks we carry?  Guaranteed to kill at
one smite."  He laughed lightly.  Something of the
spirit of the party returned to them, and they went
home more or less lighthearted.
</p>

<p>
After the old vicar was safely in bed, Darwen went
along to Jack's bedroom.  He was half expected;
he sat down on a chair while Carstairs stretched
himself, half undressed, on the bed.
</p>

<p>
"That was Sam?" Darwen asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm sure of it!  Don't know who the other
chap is, seems as if he's rounding up a gang.  What
do you think of putting the police on it?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't see how you can!  Anyhow the scandal
of it, if there was an exposure, would wreck your rosy
prospects in this town.  A young man with a fancy
for spending his nights in the woods with charming
gipsy maidens is not the sort that the wife of the
vicar of St James can allow to associate with her
daughters."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs swore volubly.  "Do you know she's
got a slavey's job at Lady Cleeve's, the local big bug's
at home."
</p>

<p>
"Did she know where you lived?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I told her."
</p>

<p>
"You were a fool."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."  Carstairs was very thoughtful.
"Damn it, she knocks spots off any girl I've seen yet.
She's improving, too."
</p>

<p>
Darwen's eyes glistened.  "I like playing with fire
myself," he said.
</p>

<p>
"It's our job," Carstairs answered, cynically.
"We're paid to do it."
</p>

<p>
"It is damn rotten for you, I admit.  Have you
got a revolver?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! but that's no good either, you mustn't
attract attention in that way.  I tell you what, we'll
set a trap and collar the brute.  You'll have to be the
bait.  And&mdash;say Bounce and I, we ought to be able
to effect a capture."
</p>

<p>
"That's so, but what then?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, anything.  Bribery, threats, or we might
shanghai the beast off to Australia."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was dubious.  "They'll give it a rest
for a bit now.  He's as cunning as a fox, that gipsy,
he knows I recognized him.  Damn him!  I'd have
hit him over the head with my stick as he passed if
the guv'nor hadn't been there."
</p>

<p>
"Well, anyway, shall we call in Bounce?  You've
already told him the story, haven't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Bounce's great idea is a heavy right on
the jaw.  'Get in close and hit hard,'" he said.
</p>

<p>
"That's very sound, too.  After your guv'nor's gone,
we'll hold a council of war.  Bounce may have some
reliable pals.  Good night, old chap, keep your pecker up."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  It's jolly good of you to lend me a hand
over a rotten business like this."
</p>

<p>
"That's alright.  As I observed before, I like playing
with fire."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I hope you won't get burnt over this.
Good night."
</p>

<p>
"Good night."
</p>

<p>
Next day the old vicar went back to his flock again
leaving a cordial invitation for Darwen to come and
see them.  Jack saw him off.
</p>

<p>
"A very fine young fellow that.  I'm glad you've
made friends with him."
</p>

<p>
"Yes!  he's a jolly good sort," Jack answered,
enthusiastically, having fresh in his memory Darwen's
offer of assistance.
</p>

<p>
The same night, Carstairs, Bounce, and Darwen
held a council of war in the shift engineer's office.
"What we wants to do," Bounce said, "is to find
out what 'e wants.  If it's murder 'e's after, we'll
shanghai 'im, if it's only a row, we'll give 'im that, but
the first thing to do is to capture 'im."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs sat on the side of the table puffing slowly
at his pipe.  "Thanks very much for the suggestion
and offer of assistance, Bounce, but I don't want to
shanghai him, I only want to get a fair show, also
I don't mind giving him a fair show if that will satisfy
him."
</p>

<p>
The Quixotic strain of the Englishman was
coming out in him.  They observed him in wonder.
"Giving him a fair show?" they queried in a breath.
</p>

<p>
He drawled very slowly.  "I mean to say," he
said, "I broke his leg.  I beat him once, but I had
some assistance; if he fancies he can give me a licking
fair and square, I don't mind giving him a trial,
provided, of course, that that is really what is worrying
him, you understand."
</p>

<p>
Bounce nodded, a compound now of comprehension
and disapproval, his face expressed a keen appreciation
of the principle involved, but a strong objection to the
practice suggested.  "It's revenge 'e's after, 'e don't
want no fair play.  Them sort o' blokes don't appreciate
fair play.  You give 'im a licking once, 'e wants to
give you one in the back now.  Most like you could
buy 'im off."
</p>

<p>
"A mixture of threats and bribes," Darwen
suggested.  "We'll capture him and frighten the wits
out of him; say that we're going to give him in charge
for attempted murder.  Then you can offer him a
small sum to go away and stay away.  We'll explain
that if he ever gets within speaking distance of you
again, you'll promptly have him arrested."
</p>

<p>
"That's it," Bounce agreed.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose that is the best," Carstairs said,
thoughtfully.  "Do you know I feel when I think of him
that a damn good licking is the only thing I can offer
him.  Yet when I consider that the poor devil is
permanently lame because&mdash;well, because I went off
with his girl, well, dash it, he has my entire sympathy.
In my case I remember distinctly that it gave me a
sensation of extreme pleasure to think I was whacking
that brute for the sake of the girl.  I'm not exactly
pugilistic, but I've never experienced anything so
pleasureable as the one or two smites I got home on
him with the idea that they were for the girl.  I can
understand the persistence with which he is following
me.  She's the finest girl in all the world."  His keen
grey eyes seemed to glow with a fierce ardour.  At that
moment he was violently in love.
</p>

<p>
They looked at him in open wonder.
</p>

<p>
He stood up and stretched himself.  "I should
feel a better man if I went out now and searched out
that gipsy and bashed him, and then went straight
across to the girl and married her.  What the devil
are these wishy-washy dances, these tuppenny ha'penny
jobs, this sham respectability?  Simply a
drag on a man's actions.  I want to do something."
</p>

<p>
Bounce nodded vigorously.  "You're fit," he said,
"trained fine.  In the pink of condition.  That's
how you feels when you comes ashore after a three
months' cruise.  'To hell with everything.  Let's
do something.'  That's it, ain't it?"
</p>

<p>
"That's it precisely."
</p>

<p>
"How you feel at the end of the 'footer' season,"
Darwen chimed in.  "Or when a match is postponed
and you've got to dissipate your energies on the desert
air.  Usually you make a thundering idiot of
yourself."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose that is so, but you enjoy it."  Carstairs
became thoughtful again.  "There are only certain
times, practically moments, when you can do these
things; you do not appreciate them in your normal
condition, besides there's the guv'nor and the mater,
and really I know very little about the girl."
</p>

<p>
Darwen clapped him on the shoulder.  "Wake
up, old chap!  You're dreaming.  You can't marry
a gipsy girl; she'd want to feed you on gipsy stew
and half-hatched pheasant's eggs."
</p>

<p>
"When you goes off to-night at twelve o'clock,
me and Mister Darwen will shadow you like, and catch
this yer Sam if he's knocking about.  I'll have a line
in my pocket so's we can tie him up."  Bounce was
very serious; he turned to Darwen.  "When shall
I meet you, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, at the corner, at five minutes to twelve."
</p>

<p>
"Five minutes to twelve at the corner?  Very
good, sir.  Good night."  Bounce was just going
when a boy came in to say that a policeman had come
to report some street light out.  Darwen went out
to see him.  "Half a minute," he said.  He was back
in a few moments with glowing eyes.  "By Jove! that's
a whacking great chap, somewhere near seven
feet, I should think."
</p>

<p>
Bounce snorted.  "Them big blokes ain't much
use," he observed.
</p>

<p>
"Would you like to take him on for a few rounds,
Bounce?"
</p>

<p>
"Well now, maybe 'e'd be mistook if 'e was to try
to 'lift' me an' I didn't want to go."
</p>

<p>
Darwen clapped his hands.  "Well done.  I'll
tell you what.  We'll put down five bob for the winner
and half a crown for the loser, and you shall mutually
arrest each other.  Start at the boiler house and you
chuck him into the street, or he lugs you into the engine
room.  How's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Very good, sir.  If 'e'll take on, that five bob's
mine."  The little sailor was very confident.
</p>

<p>
"Hurray!"  Darwen rushed out to the door to
interview the policeman and explain the terms to
him.  The big man's eyes glistened.  "There ain't
no man in this town as I can't arrest," he said.  He
glanced up and down the street.  "You'll make it
all right if the sergeant comes, sir?  You wanted my
assistance to eject a drunk bloke or something, eh?"
he winked, knowingly.
</p>

<p>
"That's alright.  We'll put a boy to watch for the
sergeant."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are, sir."  The big man followed
Darwen into the engine room with long, stately strides
and easy, confident air.  He towered a good six
inches over Darwen's head.
</p>

<p>
Bounce stood up and eyed him up and down, then
he put his hands to his mouth and gave a mock hail.
"Main top there!" he yelled.
</p>

<p>
The policeman smiled.  "Don't you come talking to
growed-up men," he said.  "Shall I take 'im now, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Half a minute," Carstairs said.  "Let's weigh
the combatants."
</p>

<p>
So they proceeded in solemn procession to the coal
scales.
</p>

<p>
Bounce was eleven stone eight and a half pounds.
"'E oughtn't to be out without his p'rambulator,"
the guardian of the law remarked, as he stepped into
the scales, and brought them up with a bang.  They
shifted the weight along the rod till at nineteen stone
eight and a half pounds it balanced.
</p>

<p>
Bounce nodded approval.  "'E'd go near ten stone
with 'is boots off," he said, with conviction.
</p>

<p>
"How tall are you?" Darwen asked.
</p>

<p>
"Six feet and a half.  I was the tallest man in the
Grenadier Guards when I was in it."
</p>

<p>
They went back to the boiler house and stood in a
clear space under an arc lamp.  The policeman took
off his long coat and helmet, "In case 'e wipes 'is
boots in it while I'm carrying of 'im."
</p>

<p>
"Open them big doors," Bounce requested, "so
as I won't 'ave to push 'im through the window."
</p>

<p>
The two men stood facing each other with smiling,
confident faces.  The big man stretched out a hand
that would have supplied a whole cannibal tribe with
a substantial meal.  "Are you coming quiet?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No!  I ain't," Bounce answered, circling slowly
round him.
</p>

<p>
The whole works watched in eagerness.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the big man made a short rush and a grab,
but Bounce was not there; instead he had dived at
the policeman's legs and pulled him down.  He made
another grab as he was falling, but the sailor was like
an eel.  He dodged, and slipping round to the back
of him, took a grip with both hands on the policeman's
collar.  "Open them doors," he shouted, shuffling
backwards and dragging the big man all along the
dirty floor.
</p>

<p>
The entire staff, on the broad grin, lined the
doorway, as Bounce dragged his burden through and
deposited it on the pavement.  Then he stood up and
tossed his shoulders with a jaunty, nautical air.
"Now, my lad, you run away, and play with the
nurse-maids," he said.
</p>

<p>
In angry silence the policeman reached out for his
helmet and coat; Darwen slipped half a crown into
his hand, and he went out into the night, tramping
sullenly along his beat.
</p>

<p>
Bounce beamed and pocketed his five shillings.
"Them big blokes ain't never no use," he said.  "Five
minutes to twelve?  Good night, sir!"  He departed.
But Darwen sat down on the edge of the table.
</p>

<p>
"Wonderful chap, Bounce."  They chatted for some
minutes, then dropped into silence.  Darwen broke it.
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake, Carstairs, don't go and do anything
silly over that gipsy girl.  It would break your
poor old guv'nor's heart; he was holding forth to
me, when you were out, about how very careful a
young man ought to be to avoid awkward entanglements:
you were so very steady, he said.  I think
he rather fancied I was not so steady.  'Young men
fly into an engagement with a girl because she sings
nicely or something superficial like that.'  Does
the gipsy sing?" Darwen laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, said she sang very well."
</p>

<p>
"Did she?  What becoming modesty."
</p>

<p>
"She was natural, that's all.  Her father told her
she was good, and she repeated it."
</p>

<p>
"Her father?  I didn't know that gipsies were
always certain on these points.  Did you see him?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, spoke to him; at least, listened to his
music."
</p>

<p>
"His music?"  Darwen made a motion of turning
a handle.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no; the violin.  I'm not much of an authority
on these things, but it seemed to me good, exceedingly
good, the best I'd heard."
</p>

<p>
"This is interesting.  Couldn't you introduce me
to the family?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  For the sake of my peace of mind I shall
have to avoid that girl like the very devil."
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap! probably St James, the footman,
has already supplanted you in the lady's affections.
Wonderfully fascinating chaps, those footmen.  By
the way, it's not usual for gipsies to go into domestic
service, is it?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't think it is."  Carstairs pulled out
his watch.  "I must go and have a look round; the
load is heavy to-night."  He opened the door and
Darwen followed him.
</p>

<p>
They went out through the engine room into the
boiler house.  Carstairs brightened up at once, the
hum of running machinery, and the bustle of working
men, was the breath of life to him; his face hardened
and his eye brightened with the "splendid
purpose."  Darwen observed him closely.
</p>

<p>
"You're a born engineer, you know, Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think so?  Sometimes I think so myself."  He
looked around him with keen appreciation at
the long row of boilers under steam, with the furnace-doors
red hot, "a beautiful orange glow" he was wont
to describe it as; at the coal-grimed, brawny men,
with the sweat running off them as they sliced up the
dazzling white fires.  He gazed critically into the
blinding glare as they opened the red hot doors, the
radiant heat scorched his face and the intense light
dazzled his eyes, so that for some minutes afterwards
everything was green and blue to him.  He looked at
the men with their hard, strong faces and their bare
muscular arms and chests, the whole scene gave him
a sensation of extreme pleasure.  To him it was more
than beautiful, it was sublime.  A sensation of
majestic force, of overwhelming power, such as a
towering mountain, the limitless ocean, or a vast
moorland conjure up.  This sensation was his now,
and it was uplifting, artistic; he felt beyond the earth;
yet in many ways there was little of the artist in him,
he was essentially of the earth, earthly.  Such is the
best type of that modern product, the Engineer.
</p>

<p>
And that you may know him when you meet him,
I will tell you that he is rather a rare bird.  At the
present time, probably, no profession contains more
"wasters" than electrical engineering; this is because
any man who can persuade a mayor and corporation or
a chief engineer to give him the job, can take charge of
many thousands of horse-power in boilers, and engines
and dynamos, with infinite possibilities of damage, and
the lives of many men resting on his direction, nerve
and knowledge.  Those dear men, who scorn to take
an interest in their work, are not the breed I mean;
nor are those greasy individuals who have arrived,
oilcan in hand, from the engine bed: they are practical
they say, which means that their minds are a storehouse
of undoubtedly useful facts, they have a fairly
clear recollection of a great number of engineering
possibilities which they have actually witnessed;
but, their reasoning powers are undeveloped, and their
methods of procedure on new lines are particularly
hap-hazard trial and error.  The engineer to whom
I refer is essentially a man of science; he is
mathematical, theoretical, and practical; he holds an
engineering degree and has been through the "shops";
he understands both men and materials and the
methods of handling them; frequently he is a lonely
sort of savage.  He knows little of billiards, cards, or
dancing; his work precludes him from much intercourse
with other men except in business hours; often
he is silent and somewhat shy with women; usually
he is of good physique and logically minded; his life-work
is the pursuit of truth; in the "shops" he learns
to file "truly," then he learns to set a thing in the
lathe "truly."  He tests his finished work carefully
to see that it runs "true," and on the test plate he
learns to measure accurately, in the drawing office to
calculate exactly; he works under, with, and over
the working man, and learns to know him better than
anyone else; he does not shine at football or cricket,
but is often a particularly useful man in a rough and
tumble fight, an accomplishment he acquires in his
progress through the "shops"; he is an individual;
he thinks and sees things as they are, for that is what
his work teaches him; he regards things carefully,
observing their quality, and speculating on the process
of their manufacture; he sums up men quickly.  In my
opinion, he is only inferior to the sailor.
</p>

<p>
The æsthetic soul of Darwen was moved, too.
"You're making 'em do their damnedest," he observed.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs nodded.  "That's what I like; you know
the Yankee definition, 'An engineer is a man who can
do for one dollar what any fool can do for two.'  It's
not bad, but like most Yankee things, it's cheap and
incomplete."
</p>

<p>
"The taint of the cheapness, old chap, is passing
from the Americans to us.  You can get quality in
the States, if you pay for it, now."
</p>

<p>
"That is so in some things, and to my mind that's
the most marked sign of progress; the nation without
quality is as a house built upon the sand.  The moral
effect on the workman who manufactures cheap
articles must be disastrous."
</p>

<p>
"The workmen, dear boy, are the people, and the
people are mud.  That is the one point upon which
I disagree with dear old Nick Machiavelli."
</p>

<p>
"And probably, as far as I know, the one point on
which I agree with him, if he says the people are not
mud."
</p>

<p>
"He does.  He quotes a proverb, 'He who builds
on the people, builds on mud,' and disagrees with it.
Personally, I think the people, the mass, don't matter
tuppence.  Our officers have made the riff raff of all
nations fight like tigers."
</p>

<p>
"That's not correct.  A relative of mine was in
Ashantee, and the coast niggers there ran like sheep.
They had to give them up as fighting material."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps so, but it's only the exception that proves
the rule, and that was because we were hampered by
sentiment.  A coward rightly handled, that is to say,
brutally handled, will achieve more than many really
brave men."
</p>

<p>
"I very much doubt that too.  I get good results
by giving the stokers a drink occasionally."
</p>

<p>
"Also you curse them occasionally."
</p>

<p>
"Well, not exactly curse them; you can't listen
to all their complaints; some of 'em would never do
any work at all if you did."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so!"  They passed on into the engine
room.  "I observe again, Carstairs, that you make
them do their damnedest."
</p>

<p>
"Again, I explain that I like doing so."
</p>

<p>
"Your coal costs are always points below mine."
</p>

<p>
"I am aware of it."
</p>

<p>
"Yet I bet the chief and old Robinson don't think
any the more of you for it."
</p>

<p>
"I have heard that the chief so far committed
himself as to say that you were the best engineer he'd
ever had."
</p>

<p>
"I heard so too, which goes to prove my point.
You are paid in this world, not for pleasing yourself,
but pleasing others.  I believe I could get my costs
down to yours, but the chief and Robinson are
eminently 'safe' men.  I shall never get a shut-down.
Old Robinson is on tenter hooks whenever you are
on evening shift.  'That chap cuts things too fine,'
he told me the other day."
</p>

<p>
"Did he?  Well! he always leaves me severely
alone on the evening shift."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, because if you get a shut-down it will
be 'in the unavoidable absence of Mr Robinson or
Mr Chief.'  See?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I see and comprehend, but don't care."
</p>

<p>
Darwen's eyes glistened with honest admiration.
"There is much of the aboriginal Saxon in you,
Carstairs, with your grey eyes and light hair and that
big, bull-dog jaw.  Rightly, you should worship Thor
and Odin, the gods of force.  It's absurd for your
guv'nor to be a minister of the Christian religion."
</p>

<p>
"I agree with your last point; we're a family of
seamen, really.  We worship Neptune."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! the sea, water, steam, electricity.  Hence
Jack Carstairs, electrical engineer, seaman twice
removed, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"About that."
</p>

<p>
"These things are always interesting.  It is
essential to understand the machine you work with,
and the people you live with.  To properly grip the
bent of a man's mind, it is necessary to know his
antecedents.  The seaman, we observe, has a natural
aptitude for engineering, coupled with great tenacity
and self-reliance, a particularly good friend, a just,
but particularly unpleasant enemy; a touch of
sentiment and superstition, the results of much
battering and erratic favours from Father Neptune.
The gipsy, on the other&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, damn that gipsy," Carstairs flushed an angry
red.
</p>

<p>
"Here we have a most interesting relic of the
Berserk rage of the Norseman.  If within reach, that
gipsy would have a particularly rough time just at
this moment."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go to the devil, Darwen."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks very much for the advice, but I will
return to the gipsy, who, as I was about to observe,
is, on the other hand, naturally a poacher and very
vindictive, and will therefore have to be poached,
that is to say, captured by stealth which&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
A sudden flash like miniature lightning illuminated
the engine room, followed immediately by a loud
report.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs' big jaw tightened.  Darwen's eyes
glittered with an æsthetic sort of joy.  "Breakdown,"
he observed, "and I'm a spectator."
</p>

<p>
A circuit fuse had blown, and was instantly followed
by a continuous flash and bang of some half dozen
fuses, going one after the other, like a straggling volley
of small artillery.  By an ingenious inter-connection
of the network of main supply cables it is arranged
that if one circuit fuse goes half a dozen immediately
follow suit.  This is one of the many diabolical
devices on which mains superintendents particularly
pride themselves.  Carstairs strode up on to the
switchboard, very alert, but very cool.  He switched
out all the switches, replaced the fuses by bigger ones,
and switched in again, the switchboard attendant
assisting him in a high state of nervous excitement.
Now there is a piece of apparatus known as a magnetic
automatic circuit breaker.  It is carefully designed
to come out at the wrong time and stay in at all other
times; the good chief of Southville, in the simplicity
of his trust in catalogues, had, "for safety," as he
expressed it, two of these devices fixed on every
machine; when, therefore, Carstairs plugged in again
on the heavier fuses, these "safety" devices promptly
opened, one after the other, all except one small one,
which hung in with a tenacity worthy of a better
cause.  The station was plunged into instant inky
darkness, relieved only by fitful flashes from the
commutators of the idle machines, the governor of
one of which having stuck, it raced away in a frantic
effort to burst its fly-wheel and wreck the engine
room; the one small machine, left all alone struggling
valiantly with a load four times too big for it, first
of all stopped dead till its field died away, then
pounded into the work with little spurts and pauses,
being helped out with a little juice from the kindly,
helpful battery (which was ruining itself in the
process).  All the boiler feed pumps, fans, and condenser
pumps stopped.  (The chief, being a wireman, liked
to have all the accessories electrically
driven.)  Pandemonium at once reigned.  There was much
shouting in the darkness, an engine-driver and a
stoker, in their frantic efforts to do something, collided
violently, and collapsed on the floor, groaning, to the
accompaniment of soft nothings, whispered sweetly
to the empty air; the boilers blew off, the steam
roared and shrieked out of twelve safety valves like
ten thousand fiends let loose; they were blowing
off for high steam first of all, and very shortly
afterwards for low water as well.  In the middle of it all,
the alternators (which were unaffected) hummed
merrily in the darkness, while the telephone bell
screamed an angry protest from an adjacent wall.
At such moments the meek and lowly Shift Engineer
feels that he is really alive; his only wish is that his
chief may happen to drop in and share his happiness
with him, or one or two of the councillors; he could
accommodate them all with comfortable seats on the
safety valves, and the possibility of a quick passage
to heaven by the shortest route, straight upwards.
Most chiefs are worse than useless on a switchboard
during a breakdown; the Shift Engineer, handling
the switches every day of his life, sometimes makes
mistakes when he is in a hurry; the chief, who handles
them once a year, always does; usually his nerves
are not as steady as they should be; he wants to know
what the Shift Engineer is going to do, and why he
doesn't do it at once, then, just to add to the general
concert, he plugs in a wrong switch.  Councillors
generally stand like fools, and wonder what it's all
about, or else button-hole the Shift Engineer and
demand an immediate explanation.  In this case, no
one appeared to hinder him, and Carstairs proceeded
all alone.  Striking a match, he went along the
switchboard and pulled out all the circuit switches; the
little machine and the battery, pulling together, then
raced away joyously and lit up the station with a
superabundant light; the switchboard attendant soon
altered that, however, and Carstairs went quickly
round the boiler house, switching out all the pumps,
etc., as very few of them had "no load releases" on,
and some that had were tied in; he glanced up at
the boiler water gauges as he passed, for he did not
want cold water to be suddenly pumped into empty
boilers.  It took him precisely one minute before he
returned to the switchboard and put in the circuit
breakers one by one, tieing them in with a piece
of insulated wire.  "Now!" he said, "we'll start
again, more or less in comfort."
</p>

<p>
He plugged in a circuit and the fuse held though the
lights grew dim, and the machines flashed and groaned.
The switchboard attendant plugged in another, and
the fuse blew in his face.  He stood shielding his eyes
in a dazed sort of way, the flash had temporarily
blinded him.  In those days things in central stations
were carefully designed to kill and maim as many as
possible; men have become more expensive since and
a little more care is taken of them, almost as much,
in fact, as of the machines.  The fuses on this low
tension switchboard were accurately adjusted to the
level of an average man's eyes and the instrument
placed just beneath, as a sort of bait, so that as he
took a reading he got the full benefit of the flash and
the molten metal flying about if a fuse went, which
they did frequently.  Carstairs stood up and pulled
the switch out, he then replaced the fuse and switched
in again.  The machine gave a groan, and a fuse at
the other end of the board blew simultaneously with
the one he had just replaced.
</p>

<p>
Ejaculating a little word that went in rhyme with
'jam,' he brought the volts down again.  "Here,
shove in that other fuse, will you?  Put a bigger one
this time."
</p>

<p>
The switchboard attendant was dancing round like
one possessed, fumbling and twitching.  Carstairs
replaced his fuse and went along to look at his assistant.
He watched him fumbling for a few minutes, then took
it out of his hands.  "Go and sit down," he said.
He finished the job himself.  "Stand clear there!"  He
motioned the switchboard attendant back.  "Stand
by those engines.  Watch the brushes and bring them
forward when they spark, far forward.  Do you hear?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," the engine drivers answered.  They
stood in expectant attitudes by their respective
engines just below the switchboard gallery.
</p>

<p>
"Alright!"  He plugged in, one after the other,
ducking his head out of the way of the possible flash.
The fuses held.  "Bring her up there!  Steady, not
too quickly!  Whoa!"  He held up his hand with
the fingers outspread, then made a circular motion.
"Get round number five," he shouted.
</p>

<p>
Promptly the driver ran up another engine, and
Carstairs put her on.  He leaned over the railing and
shouted down to Darwen, "I say, would you mind
ringing up Farrell and telling him I'm pumping 500
amps extra into something on the Moorfields Road?"
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed.  "Right you are, old chap."
</p>

<p>
Farrell was the mains superintendent; it was his
pleasant duty to turn out of his bed, round up a gang
of navvies, and dig holes in the street all night to
ascertain what that "something" was, and remove it.
The only consolation a Shift Engineer feels for the
arduousness of his existence is that sometimes the
mains man (whose life is usually cast in pleasant places)
has even a rougher time than he has.
</p>

<p>
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how electricity
is "made"&mdash;the same as everything else that is any
good&mdash;by the sweat of men.  And as men woo nature,
and she reveals her secrets to them, she demands, in
return, ever better and better of their best.  Man
moves, not to peace and plenty, to cowardice and
luxury, but to sublime courage and arduous, soulful
work, and he may not look back.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later, Farrell, a fat, prosperous looking
individual, rode up on a bicycle.
</p>

<p>
"Is it still on?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, cleared itself some time ago."
</p>

<p>
"Damn!  Just my luck!  We shall have the
devil's own job to find it now."
</p>

<p>
The two Shift Engineers laughed.  "Sorry it's not
raining, Farrell," Darwen observed.
</p>

<p>
"It's all very well for you chaps to laugh."  Farrell
went away in disgust.
</p>

<p>
Soon a little stream of men filtered in; jointers,
half awake and surly; navvies, limply, subdued,
bearing pick and shovel; it meant overtime for them.
</p>

<p>
Darwen and Carstairs stood on the doorway and
watched them disappear into the night with a
hand-cart full of tools and instruments.
</p>

<p>
They had been gone some time, Carstairs was
preparing to go home, when the telephone bell rang
violently.  It was Farrell, very excited.  "What
do you think?" he asked.  "Got it first shot, just
outside that big house at the corner.  When the lights
went out, the footman was rushing about to get
candles and lamps and unearthed a burglar, the
burglar they think, skulking in the shrubbery.  He
bolted at once and the footman chased him all down
the road.  He'd have got away too, but a paving stone
blew up right under his feet and tripped him up.  Of
course, that's the fault we were looking for."
</p>

<p>
"Of course; but how do they know he's a burglar?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he had a bludgeon with him and a big knife.
One of the windows had been forced, and they found
some jewellery in his pockets."
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen him?  What's he like?"
</p>

<p>
"A rough looking handful, they say, sort of a gipsy,
a bit lame in one leg, but he ran like a hare.  Strong
as a tiger too, nearly strangled the footman before
help arrived.  The police have noticed him skulking
round that neighbourhood for some time."
</p>

<p>
"Is that so?  Well, he's done us a good turn,
anyhow."  Carstairs was very casual, very slow, there
was no emotion whatever in his voice; he said,
"good night," and rang off.  "Ye gods," he ejaculated
to himself.  "That's my way home, of course.
Wonder what he'll get?  Jewellery in his pockets,
too, those great big pockets, built for hares and
pheasants.  'To what ignoble uses,' etc., as Darwen
would say.  Still 'living on the country,' I suppose,
as they call it in warfare."
</p>

<p>
About a quarter of an hour afterwards he saw
Darwen and Bounce.  It was with a keen sense of
amusement that he observed them "shadowing"
him.  He slipped into a gateway and waited
unobserved till they approached, and then sprang out
on them unawares.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil are you chaps following me for?"
he demanded with mock severity.
</p>

<p>
"Hang it all, Carstairs, you fool.  Play the game!
You've probably spoilt the whole show now."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, but it's not necessary now, the man's
in 'quod' for burgling."
</p>

<p>
"What!"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs told them the tale.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm blowed, these 'ere police are always
shoving their noses into somebody else's business,"
Bounce growled.
</p>

<p>
That night Carstairs slept with singular peacefulness.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
</h3>

<p>
With keen curiosity Carstairs turned up at the
police court to watch the trial of "Sam
Lee, of no fixed abode," on a charge of burglary.
The prisoner pleaded not guilty, but the evidence was
too damning, and he was sentenced to two years'
imprisonment.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs came away with a feeling of relief like a
schoolboy on holidays.  Any lingering feeling of
pity that he had entertained for the man he felt he
had wronged, was dispelled by the sight of the hard,
savage face in the dock.  He studied it closely at his
leisure and in the daylight, as the man stood there
on his defence, the beau ideal of the Bill Sykes of
fiction.  A face of very great animal strength, showing
extreme tenacity of purpose, and unrestrained passion,
in every line of the features; he was considerably
thicker and heavier about the chest and shoulders
than when Carstairs had met him face to face in the
dim light of the dawn in Scotland; the eyes had not
the shifty, suspicious expression that one associates
with the habitual criminal; they were dark and deep
set, protected by massive bony projections all round;
eyebrow and cheek bone rose in strong relief above
and below; the eye itself was steady and slowly
moving, it glowed with a sort of slumbering, malignant
hatred; he looked the magistrate and the police and
everyone else steadily in the eyes with a surly defiance.
This was the child of the moorland and the wood
transplanted to the slums, absorbing into the depths
of his strong, deep nature the terrible germs of the
diseased life of the city.  Apparently he didn't see
Carstairs, or if he did, he gave no sign of recognition.
</p>

<p>
The following Sunday Darwen was on shift, but
Carstairs went to church all alone, to St James'.
On the way out the vicar's wife and two daughters
met him.  The good lady greeted him effusively.
</p>

<p>
"And where's Mr Darwen?" she asked.  Carstairs
observed that both the daughters' eyes seemed to light
up with super-added interest as they awaited his reply.
"He's on shift," he said.
</p>

<p>
"How horrid," the elder daughter remarked,
"to have to go to&mdash;er&mdash;business on Sunday."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs laughed.  "Call it work," he said, "sort
of thing you take your coat off to."
</p>

<p>
"But not on Sunday?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, perhaps a little less than on other days.
As a matter of fact it's mostly pretence, just to show
you are really ready if necessary.  But what you really
do is to walk about with your eyes and ears as wide
open as they'll go, like the officer of a ship, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but the officers do more than that.  I've
seen them."
</p>

<p>
"So do we sometimes; in fact, in some of the
cheap and nasty stations, where the chief is an
ex-ironmonger, and the councillors are labourers out of a
job, we have to do quite a lot with our hands, and so,
of course, do less with our heads."
</p>

<p>
"Why! the chief here is an ex-ironmonger, isn't
he?"  Carstairs raised his eyebrows.  "Not exactly an
ironmonger, was he?"
</p>

<p>
The vicar's wife intervened.  "Do you think he is
really competent?  There has been a lot of
dissatisfaction in the town, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we caught a burglar for you the other night,"
Carstairs evaded the question.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm so glad!  Oh!  I hope you and Mr
Darwen will come to our little dances; we hold a
series every winter, you know.  They're rather
nice.  Mrs Mellor is the moving spirit and men are
so scarce.  They start soon now."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks very much, I shall be very pleased to,
and I know Darwen will."
</p>

<p>
Talking thus, Carstairs accompanied them till
their ways divided, then he proceeded thoughtfully
by himself to his diggings.  He sat down in the big
easy chair.  Darwen's book-shelf was at his elbow;
he glanced idly along the names on the backs.
"Curious taste for an engineer to read poetry," he
mused.  His eye rested on "The Prince" by
Machiavelli.  "Darwen's favourite," he thought.
He took it down and glanced through it.  It was
a dainty, leather-covered volume with gilt edges.
Three hours later when Darwen returned, he found
Carstairs deeply immersed in the last chapter of his
favourite book.
</p>

<p>
He looked at him curiously.  "Hullo!  Got 'The
Prince,' have you?  How do you like it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I want to think about it.  He seems to
point out that you mustn't do things by halves.  By
the way, I went to church this morning."
</p>

<p>
"Good man."
</p>

<p>
"Had a long yarn with Mrs Moorhouse and the
little Moorhouses."
</p>

<p>
"What had they got to say for themselves?"
</p>

<p>
"Said the lights were bad."
</p>

<p>
"Good."
</p>

<p>
"And that the chief was an ironmonger."
</p>

<p>
"Good."
</p>

<p>
"And they've got some dances coming off which
they hope we'll attend."
</p>

<p>
"You said we would, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and to-morrow I'm going to look up a
dancing expert and take lessons.  It's as well to do
the thing well while you're about it."
</p>

<p>
"I say again, Carstairs, there's much of the original
Saxon in you.  How long did it take you to come to
this decision?"
</p>

<p>
"About half an hour&mdash;that is to say, it took me
that time to decide that I would go in for dancing.
The rest followed as a sort of corollary."
</p>

<p>
Darwen's eyes gleamed with approval.  "I'll
play you a tune," he said; he struck a note idly and
listened to the vibrations tentatively for a few
moments.  "The foundation of engineering science
is a knowledge of the strength of material," he
observed thoughtfully.  "Before one builds a
bridge or an engine it is necessary to correctly
apportion the size and quality of the various
parts."  He struck up into a lively dance tune.
</p>

<p>
"That's a waltz, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, why?"
</p>

<p>
"I want to get the hang of the tune, that's all."
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed, and rattled on waltz after waltz,
till he was tired.
</p>

<p>
Next day Carstairs consulted the local directory
and made a note of all the teachers of dancing, and
for the following three weeks, he waltzed for an hour
a day, as regular as clockwork.  Darwen alternately
chaffed and encouraged him, but he took it all alike
with a steady, tolerant smile, puffing slowly at his
pipe.  Then the first of the little dances came off;
a select gathering of about sixty dancers with two
dear old ladies to see that the proprieties were
observed.  It was a suite of rooms in a comparatively
big house which had once been the residence
of wealthy gentlemen, but had now dropped into
the professional quarters of a dancing master.
Carstairs acquitted himself with credit, and Darwen
with distinction.  He spotted the elder Miss Jameson
(daughter of the chairman of the electricity
committee) and asked to be introduced; he danced
three times with her with great success.
</p>

<p>
She was rather small, distinctly pretty, of the doll
type; with innocent, wide-open, blue eyes, and a
perfect little mouth.  She was a good talker in a
slightly affected juvenile sort of way; her brain,
however, was more active than it appeared; she had
a lively sense of precisely what was best for Miss
Jameson.  Darwen was a good talker too, so they
rattled on brightly and humorously from one subject
to another.  She had a fine sense of humour, which
he appreciated immensely.  He brought the subject
round to the electricity works.
</p>

<p>
"I'm assisting the corporation on its way to
bankruptcy," he remarked, laughing lightly.
</p>

<p>
"How?" she enquired, and he observed by the
solid interest in her eye that she had swallowed the
bait.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I'm not doing it maliciously, of course,
only following my instructions, which are, to waste
coal."
</p>

<p>
"Really?" she asked, in doubt how to take him.
</p>

<p>
He laughed again.  "I'm not giving it away to
the poor, or anything of that sort, you know.  But
we're very, very safe here, safe from possible failure
as far as steam goes, and the price we pay for our
safety is high, excessive, it seems to me, in the matter
of coal."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but it's better to be safe, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know!  Life is run on sporting chances,
you know.  It's the ultra-cautious man who makes
a mess of things and dies young."
</p>

<p>
She laughed.  "I went over the electricity works
once with father and Mr Jones."
</p>

<p>
"What did you think of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Just nothing at all.  Father and Mr Jones were
explaining one against the other.  I don't think either
of them knew much about it."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Jones! he's not really an engineer, you know."
</p>

<p>
"No, I know; he used to keep an ironmonger's shop."
</p>

<p>
"So I've heard.  Would you care to come round
again under&mdash;h'm&mdash;more competent guidance?"
</p>

<p>
She laughed lightly and fixed him at once.  "Thanks,
very much, I will, and I shall bring a friend, an awfully
clever girl, a B.Sc.  She's interested in these sort of
things, and mother."
</p>

<p>
"I shall be really delighted; as long as you come,
I don't care who you bring."
</p>

<p>
On their way home after it was all over, Darwen
said to Carstairs, "Truly, fortune favours the bold.
Do you remember that passage of old Nick's about
fortune and women, that they both favoured the
young?  Youth is simply a matter of indiscretions;
many old fools of sixty ought to be wheeled round
in perambulators."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs paused to light a cigarette, his face
illuminated by the fitful flare of the match, was
pre-occupied, absent.  "From which I conclude,"
he observed between the puffs, "that you have been
indiscreet."
</p>

<p>
"Not indiscreet, simply bold, and you, you seem
to have something on your mind."
</p>

<p>
"Ye&mdash;es!  It's being borne in upon me very
forcibly that there is no girl that I have met yet to
compare in face or form or intelligence, that is to
say, my idea of intelligence, with a certain gipsy
maiden in Scotland, or at least, Chilcombe."
</p>

<p>
Darwen's eyes gleamed&mdash;the thrill of the waltz,
the excitement of the evening, was in his blood.
"Damme!  I must see this girl.  I observe that in
many things our tastes agree, perhaps I may be able
to relieve you of her."
</p>

<p>
"No!  By Jove! you won't!"  Carstairs faced
round abruptly and looked him in the eyes.
</p>

<p>
They looked at each other for some moments, then
Darwen smiled.  "By Jove, Carstairs, you are badly
hit."
</p>

<p>
"Well, perhaps I am.  But, you know, none of
those girls to-night gave me an impression of genuineness;
artificial and superficial, stereotyped, unoriginal,
like the pawns on a chess-board, only capable of
moving (intellectually) in one direction; they all
held precisely the same views on precisely the same
subjects, and they had absolutely no reasons for
holding them, and yet they are so superlative."
</p>

<p>
"Dear boy, they're young."
</p>

<p>
"So was the kid.  Seventeen, I think she said.
Yet she gave me the impression of having thought
about things."
</p>

<p>
"You're Saxon, Germanic, heavy.  Have you
read any German philosophy?"
</p>

<p>
"No!  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"It suggests lager beer and sausage, many generations
of 'em.  Flat, ponderous, indigestible.  I
prefer champagne, and&mdash;er&mdash;some of those French
dishes, you know."
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"Well! damn you for a Saxon, I don't either, but
I've heard of 'em.  You ought to have said you
knew!  Don't you see how you prick the effervescing
bubbles of conversation?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all!  It seems to me I'm keeping it going."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, with a sledge hammer."
</p>

<p>
"Alright.  England was built with the sledge
hammer.  I admit that I'm naturally a slogger."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely; you prefer the cutlass to the rapier."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit, I prefer the twelve-inch gun.  Which
brings me naturally to Bounce.  Do you admire
Bounce?"
</p>

<p>
"I do."
</p>

<p>
"Then I can explain.  Bounce bears the same
relation to the other men that the gipsy kid bears
to other girls."
</p>

<p>
"Then I admit that she must be good."
</p>

<p>
They let themselves into their diggings, and
Darwen sat down in an easy chair, and whistling
softly to himself one of the tunes he had just been
dancing to, he gazed absently in front of him, but
there was a happy light in his eyes; he stopped
whistling suddenly and addressed Carstairs, who
was mixing himself a whiskey and soda.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know I have an idea that our respected
chief will not be with us much longer?"
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"He'll get the sack, or have to resign."
</p>

<p>
"In that case he'll get his deserts.  Can't
understand how he got the job."
</p>

<p>
"No, you have no comprehension whatever of
the rapier, or perhaps we should say the stiletto, or
the back stairs."
</p>

<p>
"Suppose Robinson will get the job."
</p>

<p>
"Robinson will go first, I'm afraid."  There was
a touch of real sorrow in Darwen's voice.
</p>

<p>
"You're a funny chap, you know, Darwen.  Who's
going to get it, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I shall have a shot for it, of course.  How
would you like Robinson's job?"
</p>

<p>
"First class, for a time."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely.  'For a time.'  I don't imagine that
either of us will petrify here."  Darwen's eyes had
a strangely humorous glitter, he arose and stretched
his arms above his head and yawned.  "Good-night,
old chap!"
</p>

<p>
"Good-night."
</p>

<p>
A few days later Darwen showed Mrs and Miss
Jameson and their clever friend (who was also exceedingly
plain, such is the balance of nature) round the
works.  Carstairs was on shift.  His coat was off,
his hands grimy.  Darwen introduced him, the old
lady and the clever girl took possession of him.  The
clever girl catechised and examined Carstairs like a
police court lawyer.  The old lady listened with
dignity and entire mental oblivion.
</p>

<p>
Darwen and Miss Jameson wandered off by themselves.
</p>

<p>
While the clever girl was asking Carstairs for precise
chemical information as to the residual scale left
in the boiler, Darwen was explaining in an obscure
corner of the works that that collection of big tanks was
a water softener, where there were great big hammers
going round to crack up the lumps in the water.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs and the clever girl argued about "ides"
and "ates."  Darwen and the pretty girl laughed
and joked and made ribald remarks in the face of
dignified 1000 H.P. engines.
</p>

<p>
A week later the second of the little dances came
off.  Carstairs took it seriously, and Darwen lightly.
One of the dear old ladies who acted as chaperone
this time was Mrs Jameson.  Darwen was most
attentive.  He fetched her wraps when she got cold,
and saw that she had a liberal supply of the best
refreshments going.  He was asked to call on Sunday.
</p>

<p>
He did so.  The old doctor and he discussed the
electricity works.  "The place ought to pay, you
know," Darwen said, and the doctor shook his head.
</p>

<p>
Then a big dance came off, and Darwen sent Miss
Jameson a spray of flowers, white roses.  He was a
regular caller at the house now.
</p>

<p>
It was well into December and the mayor was
holding a huge reception at the Town Hall, when
the electric light failed and could not be got on again.
Darwen was on shift.  The entire switchboard was
burnt down.  The mayor in his robes and the other
councillors in evening dress, descended in anger upon
the works, which were not far from the Town Hall.
The chief was away, but Robinson was sent for in a cab.
He came, he saw, and remained helpless and useless.
</p>

<p>
Darwen was very cool and very civil, but the
councillors did not bully him, he stood inches taller
than any one of them, and there was a sort of snaky
glitter in his eye; he did not seem the sort of man to
be bullied.  It was obvious he was master of the
situation, the massive-looking Robinson was in a
pitiable state of collapse.
</p>

<p>
Next day in answer to a wire the chief returned.
The gods (which is the press) called for a human
sacrifice.  The local influence of Robinson was big,
but the chairman seemed unaccountably heavy in
favour of Darwen; then the mayor and several
aldermen had seen that Darwen knew his work, while
apparently Robinson did not.  The chief sacked
Robinson, and Darwen, as next in seniority, was
promoted in his stead.
</p>

<p>
A month later the engagement of Darwen to Miss
Jameson was publicly announced.
</p>

<p>
All this time Carstairs had pursued the even tenor
of his way undisturbed.  He grew more silent and
thoughtful than ever; of Darwen he saw very little,
except when they met at the works, or at dances,
which Carstairs still consistently attended.  There
was a light of triumph continually in Darwen's eyes;
he seemed very happy over his engagement.  After
he was made chief assistant he and Carstairs saw
more of each other at the works; they spent long
hours in consultation about the work, a common
bond seemed to be drawing them even closer together.
One day Carstairs remarked, "I'm going home for
a week end next week.  Would you and Miss Jameson
care to come with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, old man, I should like to go, and I think
the girl would too."
</p>

<p>
On the Saturday afternoon the three of them set
out for Chilcombe.  When they arrived there was
quite a house party.  Stephen, Jack's artist brother,
was at home, and Commander John Carstairs and
the Bevengtons were invited to spend Sunday.  As
the five big men sat smoking after dinner, the old vicar
repeated his congratulations to Darwen.  "I hope Jack
will be as lucky," he observed.  "Hasn't he shown
any decided preference at any of those dances yet?"
</p>

<p>
"No! honestly I can't say that I've observed it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but Jack's booked," Commander Carstairs remarked.
</p>

<p>
"How?  To whom?"
</p>

<p>
"Why! the girl he pulled out of the river, of
course.  You can't get out of that, Jack."
</p>

<p>
"Pulled out of the river?" Darwen asked in
surprise.  "You never told me, Jack."
</p>

<p>
"No.  I don't think the subject ever arose, did it?"
Jack puffed solemnly at his pipe.
</p>

<p>
"There's no need to talk about it, it's a settled
thing, eh, Jack?" the sailor would not be denied his
chaff.
</p>

<p>
They looked expectantly at him, but he continued
to puff away in silence, there was just a suspicion of
a twinkle in his eye.
</p>

<p>
"What's her name?" Darwen asked.
</p>

<p>
"Bessie Bevengton.  She's coming here to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"That's alright, Jack; I'll see that you're not
disturbed," Commander Carstairs said boisterously.
</p>

<p>
"Jack'll have to make up his mind soon then; she's
a catch in the marriage market now.  Her uncle left
her ten thousand pounds the other day."
</p>

<p>
"Ten thousand pounds!  Why, that would cover
a multitude of sins," Darwen observed.
</p>

<p>
The Reverend Hugh smiled.  "Oh, but I'm sure
she doesn't want any gilding.  She's a very nice girl
and good looking."
</p>

<p>
The budding artist opened his mouth languidly,
he was going to speak.  They paused to listen, it
seemed that he had something weighty to say.
"She's&mdash;ah!&mdash;somewhat obese, don't you know."  They
laughed.  This young man had been budding for a
very long time, but as yet he had produced no
appreciable flower.  Cheltenham and Oxford had made
him a finished gentleman, but not apparently able to
earn his own living.  He was a taller edition of Jack,
rather better looking, but he lacked the steadiness of
eye and firmness of mouth.  "If I had ten thousand
pounds I'd go to Paris and settle down."
</p>

<p>
"What should you do, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"Jack and I are working out a patent in the
corporation's time."  Darwen looked at the Reverend
Hugh with bright, hopeful eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! is that the thing you told me about, Jack?"
his father asked.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;o, this is another."
</p>

<p>
"Something better?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, hardly as valuable I expect."
</p>

<p>
"Is that the&mdash;&mdash;"  Darwen paused, but Carstairs
said no word, so he proceeded.  "The thing you're
working out on the night shift?"
</p>

<p>
"Was working out.  It's finished now, or very
nearly."
</p>

<p>
"Finished!"  Darwen's eyes grew abnormally
large and bright.  "Have you patented it?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  It's in the rough yet.  Quite a secret still."
</p>

<p>
"At the works?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;o."
</p>

<p>
"Going to make more than ten thousand out of it,
Jack?"  The sailor had been watching Darwen
intently.
</p>

<p>
"I rather hope so."
</p>

<p>
Next day the Bevengtons came back from church
with them, and spent the entire day at the Vicarage.
They were a jolly party.  Darwen, as usual, was the
life and soul of it.  He was very attentive to Miss
Jameson, but he often caught Bessie Bevengton's
eye.  Jack and she were never left alone, they
exchanged common-places and chaff.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Jack!" she said, and she seemed to watch
him closely.  "You know that handsome housemaid
at Lady Cleeve's?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes!" Jack answered, and Darwen gave him
a quick glance that Bessie saw.
</p>

<p>
"Well, a little while ago she horsewhipped the
footman; he offended her somehow.  They say she's
stronger than a good many men."
</p>

<p>
Again Darwen shot a meaning glance at Carstairs,
and again Bessie saw it.
</p>

<p>
"Bully for the girl," and there was a thrill of
admiration in his voice that was apparent to all.
</p>

<p>
"Personally, I don't like amazons," the artist
remarked.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose she got the sack?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh no.  Lady Cleeve is quite interested in her.
The footman was discharged."
</p>

<p>
"Serve him right."
</p>

<p>
There was an awkward pause in the conversation,
then Jack spoke again.  "Do you remember a man
called Bounce sailing with you, uncle?  A sailor, an
A.B., a boxer."
</p>

<p>
"Bounce?  Bounce?"
</p>

<p>
"He was on the 'Mediterranean.'"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Yes!  I remember.  Bull-dog Bounce,
they called him; he had half a dozen other nicknames,
too.  I remember one night hearing a voice on the
lower deck, 'Halgernon Hedward, I shall tell your
ma'ma of you.'  He was a splendid fellow, great pity
he left the Service."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  He's sorry himself now.  He's an engine-driver
with us."
</p>

<p>
"A pity, a great pity!  He dived overboard once
in the Indian Ocean, swarming with sharks, to get
his straw hat which had dropped over.  I had to
reprimand him for quitting the ship without leave."
</p>

<p>
They all laughed, and the sailor launched into a
host of anecdotes.
</p>

<p>
On the following Monday as they went back
together, Miss Jameson said, "What an exceedingly
nice girl Miss Bevengton is."
</p>

<p>
Jack answered "yes," so that when they were
alone together, his fiancée told Darwen that Carstairs
was not in love with Bessie Bevengton.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile things at the electricity works had
progressed, there had been another failure of the supply.
All the churches in the town were in darkness on
Sunday night, and a steam pipe had burst and scalded
a man to death.  The papers were frantic.  Some
demanded a complete review of the staff of the
electricity works, others suggested that the chief be
asked to resign.  All agreed that something would
have to be done.
</p>

<p>
The committee sat in solemn conclave.  "Who
shall we sacrifice?" they asked, and the heavy
weight of Dr Jameson made it the chief.  He pointed
out that during the short time Darwen had been
chief assistant, the coal costs had gone down
enormously, and he was in a position to say that still
further sweeping reductions could be made if that
brilliant young engineer were allowed a free hand.
Dr Jameson was known as the strong man of the
council; he usually had things his way, and he did
so now.
</p>

<p>
So Mr Jones was asked to resign, and Mr Darwen
promoted in his stead at a salary of £350 per annum.
Jones had had £500, but this was only to commence.
It was probable, the doctor said, that if he made it pay,
he would have no difficulty in getting £750 in time.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was made chief assistant at £200 per
annum to commence.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you'll get married soon now,"
Carstairs asked.
</p>

<p>
Darwen smiled happily.  "Not very long I expect.
I'm giving up these diggings, though, of course.  The
mater is coming over to live with me," he said.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
</h3>

<p>
For the next month Carstairs saw little of
Darwen except at the works; he was busy
with his mother, getting a house and supervising
the moving.  At the works they talked simply
"shop."  Carstairs was absolutely lost to everything except
engines, boilers, dynamos, etc.  For twelve hours a
day he was at the works planning, improving, overhauling.
</p>

<p>
"We'll mop off that £1000 debt, and show a profit
in the first year," he announced to Darwen
enthusiastically.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Darwen agreed, and his marvellous eyes
shone with an even greater enthusiasm.  "We'll
show 'em how to run things on this job, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"I think so."
</p>

<p>
"Rather, not a doubt of it."
</p>

<p>
In three months they knocked £1000 off the coal
bill, in spite of the strenuous opposition of certain
members of the council.
</p>

<p>
"Rummy things, those chaps making such a row
about our getting different coal and weighing it
ourselves, isn't it?" Carstairs asked.
</p>

<p>
Darwen smiled.  "The application of a little oil,"
he observed, "but they've got up against the wrong
men this time, eh?  We have the doctor solid behind
us, too."
</p>

<p>
A sudden light seemed to break in upon Carstairs.
"Oh!" he said, almost in horror.  He was honest
to the core, every fibre in his body vibrated in disgust
at such treacherous roguery laid bare under his very
eyes, as it were.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you really tumble to it?"  Darwen seemed
genuinely astonished.
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm blowed if I did! but I shall know where
to look in the future."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, quite so!"  Darwen was thoughtful, he knew
that Carstairs was a particularly keen observer.
</p>

<p>
They reconstructed switchboards and overhauled
engines.  They tested and calibrated all the consumers'
meters; some had been paying for juice they had
never used; others, and the great majority, had been
using current far in excess of that for which they paid.
Carstairs found a meter in a councillor greengrocer's
shop that must have been entirely stopped for months.
</p>

<p>
The genial representative of the people descended
into his cellar and watched the new meter being
installed.  "Are you going to make my bill lighter,
Mr Carstairs?" he asked, with an anticipatory smile.
</p>

<p>
"No, heavier, I'm afraid, Mr Green."
</p>

<p>
"What!"  The smile faded at once.  "Very
well, I shall have it taken out."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs looked at him calmly, searchingly.  "Just
as you like, of course, Mr Green.  We can't afford to
give the juice away, you know."
</p>

<p>
"You can't afford!  What do you mean?  That's
not the way to talk to consumers.  I'm afraid you
don't know your business, Mr Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
"On the contrary, I think I know it very well, Mr
Green."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, I shall bring the matter up at the next
committee.  Things are going from bad to worse."
</p>

<p>
"I think not!  However, I hope you'll do everything
possible to satisfy yourself on that point Mr
Green."  Carstairs spoke very slowly and very quietly,
it was a way he had when his anger was rising.
</p>

<p>
"That man," Darwen observed, when Carstairs
told the story, "is a little rogue.  It never pays to be
little in anything.  It's a sign of intellectual
incompetence, lack of courage and general feebleness.  I'm
glad you told me; we'll have this out in committee.
I'll break that man just to encourage the others,
eh?"  There was a glitter in his eye that Carstairs could not
quite understand.  Carstairs' brain was somewhat
heavy and ponderous, but once on the move in any
direction, it rolled onwards with an irresistible sweep; he
was a ruthless searcher after truth according to his light.
Darwen himself had set the wonderful mechanism of
his brain moving in the direction of suspicion, he
now began almost unconsciously to suspect his friend.
</p>

<p>
At the next committee meeting Darwen awaited
the attack of Mr Green in smiling affability, but it
never came.  The little rogue had thought better of
it.  However, Darwen was not to be baulked.  Producing
a number of bills, consumers' meter reading,
calculations of probable consumption, etc., he attacked
Mr Green.  The little man arose in his wrath, lost his
head and shouted.  Darwen smiled and smiled, and
played with him, as a cat plays with a mouse; then he
squashed him with overwhelming evidence and demanded
an apology for personalities.  The little man
gave in, he almost wept; Darwen was so big, so
suave, so very acute, so merciless and so cool; it
almost broke his heart; he got up, a shattered,
nerveless wreck, and left the room.
</p>

<p>
"Now, gentlemen, I think we may proceed to
business."  The talons were sheathed, he was so
genial, so pleasant, that it was scarcely possible to grasp
the fact that this was the same man who had just
crumpled up the little greengrocer like an empty
paper bag.  Many of the other councillors shifted
uneasily in their seats and fear gnawed at their hearts;
they cast shifty, uneasy glances at the young handsome
engineer.  What was this awful thing they had raised
up in their midst?  Even the massive, grand old
doctor at the head of the table was subdued; he gazed
straight at Darwen in solemn thought; perhaps he
was wondering whether this was, after all, the sort of
man he ought to entrust his daughter's happiness to.
</p>

<p>
That evening the proceedings in the committee
room were reported verbatim in the local papers,
and more than that, some of the London papers had
a short pithy paragraph exaggerating the event.
Of course there was nothing for it, the little councillor
had to resign.
</p>

<p>
Darwen's mother had taken a nice house, small,
but in a good part of the town, and the day after
the eventful committee meeting, Carstairs went there
to dinner.  The rooms were tastefully furnished.
Carstairs commented to himself that the feminine eye
and hand were apparent everywhere; he went in
with Darwen, and, as he was left in the drawing-room
alone for a few minutes while Darwen went to look
for his mother, he looked round at the water colour
paintings on the walls, the cabinet of old china, the
frequent ornaments, statuettes, bronze and marble:
he felt somehow that it had a Frenchy tone; at any
rate, was unlike any other room he had ever been in;
it was the sort of thing he felt that his brother Stephen,
the artist, would admire.  Darwen's mother he
imagined as tall, artistic, graceful (bearing in mind
Darwen's face and form), beautiful and brilliant.
The poets, that he remembered in their diggings,
were scattered over the table; he noted that the
bindings of all were beautiful and expensive, too.
"The Prince" was not among them.
</p>

<p>
He heard voices outside, Darwen's he knew; and
another, full, rich, contralto.
</p>

<p>
The door opened.  "Let me introduce you to the
mater, Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stood up and held out his hand.  His face
showed no emotion whatever, but in his brain was
deepest wonder.  The woman who stood before him,
the mother of that graceful, accomplished son, the
designer of these rooms, was almost short and very
broad, full chested, broad hipped, her hair was light
brown and very luxuriant.  But the face&mdash;probably
at one time it had been handsome in a masculine sort
of way, now&mdash;the skin was of an exceedingly coarse
texture, lined with innumerable small wrinkles and of
a uniform weather-beaten red; the eyes were bloodshot,
clouded; the eyes of a drunkard, or at least a
heavy drinker.
</p>

<p>
"How do you do, Mr Carstairs?  Do sit down."
</p>

<p>
The manner was distinctly "loud," and looking at
the speaker, the voice seemed to lose half its charm.
</p>

<p>
"How do you like our home, Mr Carstairs?"
</p>

<p>
"Very much indeed.  I was admiring this room
when you came in!"
</p>

<p>
The clouded eyes seemed to light up with a flash
of pleasure.  "Charlie does all this.  I haven't got
any taste in these things."  Carstairs was more
astonished than ever, but he made a remark which occurred
to him as suitable, then they drifted into generalities.
She asked Carstairs about his home.  "I know that
part fairly well," she explained.  "I've hunted over
a good bit of it."
</p>

<p>
"Have you?"  Carstairs was genuinely surprised.
Darwen had never told him.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Darwen laughed, rather a coarse laugh.  "That
is to say, I followed the hounds, while Charlie was at
school at Clifton.  I used to have a day out occasionally,
just to remind me of old times."  She sighed
deeply.  "I was brought up in the Quorn district, you
know."
</p>

<p>
"That's Leicester way, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Round there.  That was where I met Charlie's
father.  Poor dear Tom, he wasn't much of a
horseman."
</p>

<p>
"I used to follow them sometimes when I was a
kid," Carstairs observed.
</p>

<p>
"Did you?  I suppose you would."  She looked
him over with approving eyes, somewhat, he felt,
as a groom looks over a nice horse; and there was no
doubt Carstairs was a very fine animal.
</p>

<p>
A gong sounded in the hall, and Mrs Darwen rose.
"That's dinner," she said, "come on in."
</p>

<p>
She led the way and Carstairs followed, lost in
wonder, as he contemplated a rear view of her squat,
ungainly figure.  At dinner she drank a stiff glass of
whisky and soda.  Carstairs carefully avoided looking
at it; he knew Darwen was watching him closely.
Both the young men were rather silent, but the old
lady rattled away.
</p>

<p>
"Do you play football&mdash;rugby?  Yes, you would
of course!  Charlie's a splendid player.  I used to
turn out and watch him, stood about in the damp
grass and got the rheumatism thoroughly into my old
bones," she laughed again, a louder, coarser laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Not so very old, I expect, Mrs Darwen," Carstairs
was trying his 'prentice hand at a compliment.
</p>

<p>
She laughed aloud.  "Ha, ha!  Charlie'd do better
than that, he can pay compliments like his father.
Ah! his father was a rare hand at that game, or any
other game.  So's Charlie, he's a thorough sportsman.
'Always go straight, boy,' that's what I taught,
'over hedges and ditches, straight ahead.'"  She
gesticulated with her arms.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs felt rather embarrassed.  Darwen was
unusually silent, but his mother talked away and
laughed and joked.  After dinner they smoked a
cigar apiece and Darwen seemed to wake up, but still
he was serious.  "From your description, mater, I
imagine the guv'nor was something like Carstairs here."
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes, something."
</p>

<p>
"But dark, I suppose?" Carstairs asked, looking
at Darwen's almost swarthy complexion.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear no!  He was fair, quite as fair as you."
</p>

<p>
"Was he really?"
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was in answer to Carstairs' puzzled look,
or perhaps just as the wayward fit took her.  Anyhow,
she volunteered an explanation.
</p>

<p>
"The Darwens were French," she said, "a good
French family&mdash;Huguenots.  They came to England
about six generations ago.  They were fair, but there
was once an inter-marriage with a noble Florentine
lady, and ever since then there have been occasional
dark Darwens.  Charlie is one."  She threw back
her head.  There was much pride and something of
defiance in her tone.
</p>

<p>
"Mater, you never told me before."
</p>

<p>
"My boy, you never asked me."
</p>

<p>
"No, that's true."  Darwen was very silent for some
minutes, and Carstairs could find nothing to say.
"Then it's possible that I may have some of the blood
of Old Nick in me."  It was said quite seriously.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Darwen burst into a harsh scream of charwoman
laughter.  "My boy, you've got a touch of the devil
in you right enough."
</p>

<p>
"I meant Machiavelli," Darwen explained.
</p>

<p>
"Who is he?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mater!  He was an exceedingly clever Italian.
He stripped the common facts of human existence of
their halo of sentiment and showed things as they are;
here in England we suffer from the despotic sway of a
fetish called 'fair play.'"
</p>

<p>
"Fair play is a jewel," Carstairs observed, doggedly.
</p>

<p>
"There you are!  Look at that!"  Darwen pointed
excitedly at Carstairs.  "Behold the Saxon, yellow-haired,
blue-eyed, clasping his gilded idol frantically
to his bosom."
</p>

<p>
"He's not yellow-haired and he's not blue-eyed,
and he's clasping his own big biceps across his bosom,"
Mrs Darwen observed laughing.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs, leaning back with folded arms, laughed too.
</p>

<p>
Darwen shrugged his shoulders helplessly.  "I'm
in a strange country, I cannot comprehend.  'Don't
hit a man when he's down,' you say.  Why! that's
the only time you've got a chance to really punish
him.  Oh, the fearful and wonderful Saxon brain!"  He
stood up, and stretching both arms above his head,
gazed upwards at the ceiling.  "Surely, surely, the
Saxon is the devil personified.  The Lord, the great
Lord Nature, has endowed the Saxon with mighty
biceps and a head of surpassing density.  The
yellow-haired son of darkness has spread himself over the
globe.  'I cannot think: thou shalt not think,'
has been his maxim and his passport, and, because
of the magnitude of his biceps and the paucity of his
ideas, he has cramped the intellect of the world.
With his biceps the Lord endowed the Saxon with one
idea, one commandment, 'Thou shalt not yield.'  And
the races of mankind, the multitudes of humanity,
have spent themselves in vain endeavours to combat
this idea.  He has driven the Red man from America,
the Black man from Australia.  He stole the very
country he lives in from a more intellectual, more
civilized, and more refined race.  Not once but many
times has he been beaten, well beaten and rightfully
beaten, but he could not see it."  Darwen let his
arms drop listlessly to his sides.  "The Saxon has
broken the heart of the world."
</p>

<p>
His mother went over to him and put her hand
affectionately on his shoulder; she seemed rather
concerned.  "My boy!  You were always a sportsman,
always clean; many's the time I turned out in
the rain on the wet grass, in the wind or the frost to
watch you play, and you were always straight, always
clean; I knew the game and I watched you."
</p>

<p>
He looked into his mother's eyes.  "I was, mater,
always straight, never cheated."
</p>

<p>
She looked proud and happy.  "I know, I know!"
she said.  "You got that from me, from my side,
your grandfather was a splendid sportsman.  He rode
right across country, straight as the crow flies, over
hedges and ditches and walls, always straight, quite
straight."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he agreed, "that's how I played, always
straight.  But I never, for the life of me, could see
why."
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  "Because it's not right, you
wouldn't feel the same if you won by cheating."
</p>

<p>
"You're the best mater in all the world."  He smiled
at her affectionately.  "But you have the intellectual
limitation of the Saxon; history teaches me that it's
useless to argue with you."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs had been sitting still, staring straight
ahead; he arose and looked at his watch.  "I'm afraid
I must be going.  I want to get out those figures&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, my dear chap," Darwen took him by
the arm.  "Come on into the other room, and I'll
play you a tune."
</p>

<p>
"What do you say, Mrs Darwen?"  Carstairs
looked at her quite seriously.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you'll stay, of course."
</p>

<p>
So he stayed.
</p>

<p>
"You and the mater," Darwen remarked, as they
made their way into the other room, "ought to get
on as thick as thieves, you're both so very Saxon."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs laughed.  "In the light of your recent
little oration, I'm sure we're both highly flattered,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
On his way home late that night, Carstairs was very
thoughtful.  "So Darwen was right, there was a
touch of the Dago in him; the subtle Italian
diplomatist, crossed with the dashing English-French
sportsman, a strange mixture."  He pondered deeply.
</p>

<p>
Next morning on his way to the works, a policeman,
an acquaintance made in the dark days of his shift
engineering career, stopped him.  "Have you heard
the news, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  What news?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr Darwen's house was burgled last night."
</p>

<p>
"Last night?  Why I was there up till half-past
eleven.  Did they get away with much?"
</p>

<p>
Policeman X19 smiled.  "More than they wanted,
sir.  Mr Darwen heard a noise and come down with a
bull's-eye lantern and a revolver.  They fired almost
together; 'e hit Mr Darwen in the arm, and Mr Darwen
plugged 'im through the chest.  Our men's on his
track, now."
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord, I must go along and see him."  Carstairs
turned off towards Darwen's house.  As he went up
the garden path, he passed a rather pretty girl, neatly
dressed, going out.  He raised his hat and also his
eyebrows at the same time.
</p>

<p>
She stopped and blushed slightly.  "Oh, Mr
Carstairs, I heard Mr Darwen was shot and came
round to inquire if it was serious."
</p>

<p>
"You didn't tell me," he said.
</p>

<p>
"No, I didn't know till you'd gone."
</p>

<p>
He found Darwen having breakfast with his mother.
His left arm was bound up, but he seemed jubilant and
happy.  His mother also seemed the same.  "It was
most exciting.  Something woke me up just about
two o'clock.  Don't know what it was, but while I lay
awake I thought I heard somebody, the noise was very
slight.  Anyhow I went down to see, accompanied
by a bull's-eye lantern, which I'd only bought the day
before, and a small bore revolver.  I located the
disturber just coming out of the drawing-room, I
was on the stairs.  I hadn't made a sound, but he had
a revolver in his hand, and as soon as he saw the light
he let fly."
</p>

<p>
"I heard two shots, one just after the other, nearly
frightened me out of my life&mdash;"  Mrs Darwen took up
the tale.  "The brute tried to kill him, and now he
won't prosecute him.  You remember the way he was
talking about fair play last night, Mr Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
Darwen smiled apologetically.  "The poor devil
has had enough, though it's not a very serious wound.
I tied him up, gave him some brandy and a pipe of
tobacco.  He's a unique specimen, born in the woods,
and bred at sea, on sailing ships; hardly civilized,
but quite a decent chap, very susceptible to music;
only he's deficient in moral sensibilities.  Like
me."  He looked at his mother and laughed.
</p>

<p>
She looked triumphantly at Carstairs.  "And he
won't give him up to the police.  He's upstairs in
Charlie's bed, and he wants me to nurse him and keep
it dark.  What do you think of it, Mr Carstairs?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, if the wound should prove serious&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, there's no fear of that."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs smiled.  "It's an interesting experiment,"
he remarked.
</p>

<p>
Darwen pushed back his chair and stood up.  "I'll
come down to the works with you," he said.  He got
his hat and they went out together.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," Carstairs remarked as the front
door banged behind them, "I met my landlady's
daughter as I came in."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I know.  Came to ask if it was anything
serious.  Jolly decent of her."
</p>

<p>
"That's so.  I think Mrs Hughes took quite a
motherly interest in you.  The grub's not half as
good since you left."
</p>

<p>
"Is that so?  I used to give the girl a little
instruction on the piano occasionally you know, perhaps
that made the difference."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I see.  I didn't know that."
</p>

<p>
"No-o.  It was only occasionally you know, when
you were out, and there was nothing else to do.  She's
rather an intelligent girl."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she looks that."
</p>

<p>
They arrived at the works.  Carstairs was proceeding
to his own office, but Darwen stopped him.
"Come into my room for a minute and have a chat."  They
sat down in the comfortable, almost luxurious
office.
</p>

<p>
"Who do you think that burglar was?"  Darwen
looked at Carstairs with a humorous light flickering
round his big brown eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't any idea.  Sam's in quod, still&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;but this is Sam's mate."
</p>

<p>
A heavy frown gathered on Carstairs' brow.  "How's
that?  Did he make a mistake?  Was it me he was
after, or&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Darwen did not answer for a minute; he watched
Carstairs' face thoughtfully, he seemed to be speculating
on something.  "No," he said, at length.  "He
made no mistake, not a single one; for a man who
can neither read nor write he's very intelligent, but
the fates were against him.  Do you believe in Fate?"  Darwen
had a way of digressing at critical points which
always jarred on the mathematically direct mind of
Carstairs.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, hang Fate!"
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap! you can't.  I say he made no
mistakes.  He came there to kill, to kill me, and he'd
have done it, but I happened to be awake and I
fancied I heard a noise.  It was pure fancy, mind,
because he was in his bare feet, and silent as a mouse.
It was so much fancy, in fact, that I lay in bed debating
with myself whether I should go down.  I reasoned
thus: Everything is quite still, but it may have been
a noise that woke me.  I am awake, why should I
not go down?  If I go down to look for burglars, I
ought to be prepared to receive them, therefore I will
take a loaded revolver and my nice new bull's-eye
lantern.  Do you know I felt quite a childish pleasure
in lighting up that new bull's-eye lantern."
</p>

<p>
"How do you know he came to kill you?"
</p>

<p>
"He said so."
</p>

<p>
"He said so?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I told him I had a pretty good idea of the
plot.  The Irishman had given it away, I said."
</p>

<p>
"The Irishman?  What Irishman?"
</p>

<p>
Darwen smiled.  "That's precisely what I wanted
to know.  There are on the electricity committee,
three Irishmen, two Welshmen, four Englishmen, and
one Scotsman."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs remained silent.
</p>

<p>
"Would you like to make a guess?" Darwen asked.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Pat Donovan."
</p>

<p>
"Right in once."  Darwen's eyes sparkled.  "You
know a devilish lot about machinery, but I admit I
thought you were rather a fool as far as men were
concerned."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  What's the rest of the yarn?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, let me go back a bit."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs sighed.
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed.  "When we had that unpleasant
incident in the committee the other day, I watched
'em all, carefully, as I made my points.  When Green
called me a rogue and a liar, I watched 'em all.  They
didn't seem to think it a very grave charge.  But
when I answered him, when I said, 'You've called me
a rogue and a liar, Mr Green, but I think you'll find
if you carefully analyse your feelings on the matter,
that it's my honesty and not my roguery, that annoys
you.  I'm sorry I can't see things as you do, Mr Green,
but I'm a sportsman, and anything that appears to
me unfair, or that I can't fully grasp, I invariably
expose to the daylight, and turn and twist it till I
can understand it, or till I let daylight into it.  That's
my method, Mr Green, and I may assure you that it is
as unalterable as the laws of the Medes and Persians.'"
</p>

<p>
"How's that for eloquence?  We used to run a sort
of parliament at school, rather good practice, you
know."  Darwen laughed lightly.
</p>

<p>
"Very good," Carstairs observed.
</p>

<p>
"So they all agreed, and Mr Pat Donovan (publican
and bookmaker) made a most vehement speech in
support of it.  But when I was making it, and several
other little points, I observed that the majority of
them looked a sort of pea-green colour.  Have you
ever been sea-sick?"
</p>

<p>
"Heaps of times."
</p>

<p>
"Then you'll appreciate how they felt.  They
wanted to get out and walk but they couldn't, and
the way Donovan and M'Carthy rubbed it into poor
old Green was astonishing.  The Irish are really a
wonderful people.  I summed it up that there were
two honest men in all that committee; one was Dr
Jameson at the head of the table, and the other was
Mr John Brown, navvy, at the foot of the table.
I observed them with the greatest possible interest;
the study of mankind is all-enthralling.  Those
representatives of the several parts of these tiny little
islands were as distinct as possible; the Irish, loud
and violent; the Welshmen, quiet and sly; the
Englishmen, two of them justly indignant, and two
just a trifle uneasy; the Scotsman, like an owl, very
wise.  Now I'll bet if there were a public inquiry
on those men, the two Englishmen who have made
perhaps £20 each, would come off worst.  The
Irishmen, who have made perhaps £50 or £60 per annum,
would be next.  The Welshmen, who have made about
the same, would be let off lightly.  The two honest
Englishmen would have a stain on their characters
till their dying day, and the Scotsman, who has
probably been making a steady £500 per annum, would
leave the court without a stain on his character.
People would cheer wildly in the streets, and frantic
fools would rush forward to shake him by the hand&mdash;then
he'd reluctantly accept a modest salary of £200
per week to show himself on the music-hall stage,
and send a few simple manly letters to the papers
acknowledging the receipt of a large public subscription
to keep his old mother (who'd been dead years) out
of the workhouse."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs laughed. "You seem down on the Scotch.
Personally I liked them when I lived there."
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap, Scotsmen in Scotland and Scotsmen
in England are two different things.  Besides,
I'm not down on them a bit.  The Scotch are a
supremely intellectual race, they are eminently
gilt-edged.  I knew that the Scotsman would never
attack me, he'd rely on other people doing that.
The Englishmen, hampered by their ingrained ideas
of fair play, would have sent anonymous letters,
warning me to be careful.  The Welshmen would
be very cautious.  Only the Irishmen would act so
promptly.  This, of course, is only the opening of the
ball.  I'm going to stir up this hornet's nest properly,
the place simply stinks of roguery, and I want your
help.  You'll stand by me, old chap?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I will."
</p>

<p>
Darwen held out his hand, he looked at Carstairs
with great admiration.  "You're a pure Englishman,
Carstairs, and I honestly believe the Englishman is
the salt of the earth; he's a bit slow in the top story,
but he's hard and fit, and he's a pal all the time,
which I think is the real keynote of why he owns such
a large section of the earth."
</p>

<p>
There was a knock at the door and the office boy
entered.
</p>

<p>
"Councillor Donovan to see you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Alright; show him in."
</p>

<p>
A tall, heavy-shouldered, large-headed man with a
short nose and a long, clean-shaven upper lip, red-haired,
and with a slight squint, rushed enthusiastically
up to Darwen and shook him by the hand.  "It's
right pleased I am to see ye looking so well and fit
after the dastardly outrage on ye last night, Mr
Darwen."
</p>

<p>
Darwen smiled cordially, and returned his grasp
warmly.  "It's very kind of you, Mr Donovan, but
it's the sort of thing that's only likely to occur once
in a lifetime, thank God."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, yes.  Shure, an' such a thing cud niver
happen again in a civilized town like Southville.
I'm just off to call a special meeting of the police
committee this minute, Mr Darwen."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that's like you, Mr Donovan!  So energetic.
There's no fear of their going to sleep while you're
on the council.  I'm just off to Dr Jameson myself."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs watched them for a minute as they stood
hand in hand, smiling compliments into each other's
faces, then he opened the door quietly and went out
into the engine room.  He looked round on his
smoothly-running, even-turning friends; he had been
wont to remark that the applied logic of a running
steam engine was the thing that appealed to him
most, but now&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"They do seem rather tame after men, somehow,"
he said, to himself.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
</h3>

<p>
For a month things went on quite smoothly.  The
police, although spurred to strenuous efforts by
the glib tongue of Pat Donovan, J.P., absolutely failed
to discover any trace of Darwen's assailant.  Something
seemed to be on the mind of Mr Donovan too,
but Darwen still smiled.  "I'm taking that man into
my service when he's able to get about again, he's
going to take on the job of gardener, etc."
</p>

<p>
"What will Mr Donovan say?"
</p>

<p>
"He won't know.  That's what's worrying him
now, he can't make out what has become of his man.
Mr Donovan will move again shortly.  The Irishman
can never wait."
</p>

<p>
They were carrying out extensions at the works,
adding a wing to the engine room, and one day, a few
weeks later, Carstairs and Darwen were standing in
the new part, just underneath some scaffolding where
some men were working under the roof; they were
discussing an important point, but Carstairs noticed
that Darwen seemed a trifle absent-minded.  He kept
looking away, up at the men working.  Suddenly,
without any warning, he pulled Carstairs aside, next
moment a heavy iron bar crashed down on the concrete
at their feet, just as a man's voice sang out,
"Look out below."
</p>

<p>
"By George, that would have corpsed us," Carstairs
said.
</p>

<p>
"Our friend above there was a little late in warning
us," Darwen observed.  There was a sort of pleased
light in his eye, he seemed strangely buoyant.  "He's
drunk," he continued, "I've been watching him, he's
a new man, on to-day.  I'll go up and tell the foreman
to send him home."  He walked over to the ladder,
then he stopped, and picking up the iron bar stood
it carefully upright in a bolt hole.  "You might go
into my office and get those papers, will you?  I'll
be with you in a minute," he said over his shoulder
as he mounted the ladder.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs went away, leaving the engine room empty.
</p>

<p>
There were three or four men on the scaffold, all
working with their faces to the wall, only one man was
out further than the rest.  Darwen walked along the
planking, balancing easily and gracefully; the men
bustled ahead with their work as they saw him
coming.  He stopped at the man who was furthest out,
the man who had dropped the bar.
</p>

<p>
"My friend," Darwen asked, quietly, "have you
anything to say?"
</p>

<p>
The man looked up with a piteous appeal.  He was
a sickly white and as sober as a judge, he trembled
in every limb.
</p>

<p>
Darwen watched him in silence for some minutes
as his quivering lips moved inarticulately.  He was
a tough-looking citizen with a low, unintelligent
forehead, and strong, brutal jaw; his imagination
was so dull that cruelty had to be brought very near
home before his sluggish mind began to move.  A sort
of instinct, apparently, seemed to warn him that he
was in danger; he seemed fascinated by Darwen's
eyes, he gazed hopelessly and fixedly into them.
He made a movement to edge away.
</p>

<p>
Darwen was gripping a tie rod over his head and
standing very close to the man, who was sitting on
the plank.  He glanced round, no one was looking.
"Fortune favours the bold," he said.  Next minute
his foot shot out, and the man was off the plank.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Christ!" he screamed, as he fell through the
air.
</p>

<p>
Darwen shouted for help and clung to his tie rod
with both hands.  "That man's killed," he said.
"He was drunk.  He'd got no business to be on a
scaffolding in that condition.  Where's the foreman?"
</p>

<p>
They went below.  A little crowd gathered and
looked at the man; he was quite still, his head had
struck the iron bar and his brains were scattered over
the new concrete engine bed.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stood by in solemn silence, looking at the
thing which had been a man.  "That's the chap that
dropped the bar, isn't it?" he asked, at length.
</p>

<p>
"Yes!" Darwen answered.  "He was helplessly
drunk.  Where's the foreman?" he looked round.
</p>

<p>
"Here, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Why did you allow that man to go up there when
you saw he was drunk?"  Darwen was very stern,
his eyes seemed to look through the man.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't notice that he was drunk, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Didn't notice!  What do you mean?  That's
your job, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That'll do!  How long has he been with you?"
</p>

<p>
"Only this morning, sir.  He came down with a
note from Councillor Donovan asking to give him a
start."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! well, I suppose you can't be responsible for
every strapper that you have to put on."
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
Two of his mates reverently covered the remains
with an engine cloth, and Darwen and Carstairs went
away together.  Carstairs was very thoughtful.
</p>

<p>
"Did you hear what he said?" Darwen asked,
when they reached his office.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Councillor Donovan."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  He seems unfortunate in the choice
of his tools."
</p>

<p>
"You were up by him when he fell, weren't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite close, but, of course, I hadn't a chance to
save him."
</p>

<p>
"No, of course.  It's a very awkward job."
</p>

<p>
"Very.  I say old chap, come on home and spend
the evening with me, will you?  The girl's away, and
I know the mater will be pleased to see you."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  I&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Come on, old chap, you've got nothing to do, I
know."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I have really got a lot to do, but still&mdash;it
will keep."
</p>

<p>
As they went out together, a girl passed them.
</p>

<p>
"That's rather a nice-looking girl," Darwen remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Ye-es; I didn't notice her very particularly."
</p>

<p>
"Dash it, Carstairs, it's time you did.  Why don't
you get engaged, give you something to do in your
evenings."
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know, there's that girl over at your place.
She struck me as being a particularly nice girl."
</p>

<p>
"You mean Bessie Bevengton.  She is jolly
decent&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There is some one else?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly."
</p>

<p>
"But you can't marry her."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."
</p>

<p>
"What!  Don't be an ass!"  Darwen turned and
gazed at him in amazement.
</p>

<p>
"You see she appeals to me in so many ways."
</p>

<p>
"How?  She's handsome, that's all!"
</p>

<p>
"That's only the beginning, she's so very fit, and so
full of pluck.  You see, if I have any kids I want 'em
to be sportsmen, to play rugger and that sort of thing."
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed aloud.  "How old are you,
Carstairs?"
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-three."
</p>

<p>
"I thought you were fifty."
</p>

<p>
"Alright, but you've got a lot to thank your mater
for."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, you're right!"  Darwen was very
thoughtful for some minutes.  "Yes," he said at
length.  "I keep myself fit because the mater brought
me up that way, and fitness means so much."
</p>

<p>
"To a station man it usually means all the difference
between success and failure; you remember how that
shock I got upset me, for some time Thompson thought
I was no good."  Carstairs was thinking that if it
had not been for that shock their positions at that
moment might have been reversed.
</p>

<p>
"That is so, particularly if he's got a crowd like
Donovan and Co. to deal with.  Do you know,
honestly I never in all my life experienced such a
thrill of exquisite pleasure as when I exchanged pistol
shots with that poor devil on the stairs that night;
that's fitness, you know, simply fitness.  I'm in the
pink of condition."  His eyes sparkled like living
jewels.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs looked at him with open admiration.
"You are fit," he said.
</p>

<p>
They were passing St James' gymnasium, a sudden
idea seemed to seize Darwen.
</p>

<p>
"Come on in," he said, "and let's have a turn
with the gloves.  I've never had a turn with
you."
</p>

<p>
"Alright," Carstairs answered.
</p>

<p>
So they went inside.  The place was empty, so they
had it to themselves; they changed and donned
boxing gloves.  They looked a superb pair of men as
they stood up facing each other, in long flannel
trousers and singlets; Carstairs was a trifle shorter
and a trifle heavier; neither of them was an inch
under six feet.  For half an hour they boxed, hitting
fast and furious, and although Carstairs was as quick
as a panther, Darwen was quicker, and had distinctly
the best of the bout.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, old chap!  You do put 'em in," he
observed, as Carstairs landed a heavy right hander.
</p>

<p>
"Yours are fairly hefty, too," Carstairs answered,
as Darwen knocked him against the wall.
</p>

<p>
Then they had a cold shower, dressed, and went
back to Darwen's home, feeling at peace with all the
world, forgetting Councillor Donovan and the dead
man in the engine-room and all other troubles.
</p>

<p>
Darwen let himself in and took Carstairs into the
drawing-room.  "Sit down in that big chair, old chap,
and I'll play you a tune.  The mater'll soon come in
when she hears the music."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs threw himself back in the deep padded
chair with a sigh of content.  "I envy not in any
mood," he started and stopped.  "Where's that
from, Darwen?"
</p>

<p>
"Tennyson's 'In Memoriam.'"  Darwen was
turning over some music folios.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's it.  I remember.  I picked it up one
day in the digs and that caught my eye.  It goes on
to say something else about noble rage and linnets,
or something, but what I 'envy not' is the man who's
never been tired."
</p>

<p>
"I agree with you.  Being tired, with the pleasant
contemplation of work well done and sitting in a
comfortable chair, is heaven."
</p>

<p>
"Precisely.  And you never get tired, really,
pleasantly tired, unless you're fit.  The man who's
not fit, doesn't appreciate comfort or discomfort,
he's only half alive."
</p>

<p>
"That is so.  I think this is your favourite."  Darwen
commenced to play, lightly and slowly.
</p>

<p>
"That's that nocturne business, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"One of them.  There's a book full."
</p>

<p>
"Well, they're jolly good."  He lay far back in
the chair and spread his legs wide in front of him,
his thoughts wandered pleasantly under the slow
stimulation of the music.  Darwen himself seemed
to revel in it too, they were silent for some time;
when the door opened and Mrs Darwen came in.
Carstairs, sitting motionless in the chair, turned his
head at the sound, and then suddenly sprang up.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! why did you do that?  I wouldn't have
disturbed you for worlds."  She held out her hand.
"How are you?"
</p>

<p>
"First class, thanks."
</p>

<p>
"I could see that from the way you were sitting,
men only sit quite still like that when they've had a
good day at something.  When Charlie used to come
home&mdash;why, what have you been doing?" she looked
closely at one of his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs rubbed it thoughtfully.  "I don't think
it'll get black," he said.
</p>

<p>
"He's knocked my mouth all side ways, too, mater!"
Darwen said over his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Darwen laughed.  "What would the councillors
think if they saw you two knocking each other about
like that?"
</p>

<p>
"The councillors, dear mater, are beneath contempt.
Let's talk about something pleasant.  I've been
urging Carstairs to get married."
</p>

<p>
"Who to?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, anybody."
</p>

<p>
"Is he in love?"
</p>

<p>
"That's just it, he thinks he is."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you marry the girl you're in love with, Mr
Carstairs, and don't take any notice of anybody."
</p>

<p>
"But she's impossible, mater."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean by impossible?  I don't
believe in impossibility.  If you're in love with the girl
and she's in love with you, marry her, Mr Carstairs,
and snap your fingers at everybody.  It's better for
you and for the girl and for everybody concerned.
I hate those busy bodies who talk about 'impossible
marriages.'"  She seemed strangely excited.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs looked steadily into her excited, inflamed
eyes.  "I agree with you entirely, Mrs Darwen.
The girl I'm in love with is a gipsy.  She's a servant
in a big house near my home."
</p>

<p>
"A servant?"  Mrs Darwen seemed in doubt for a
moment.  Then the look of resolution again hardened
in her eyes.  "It doesn't matter what she is.  Are you
really in love?"
</p>

<p>
"I was."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I see you're not.  Once in love, always in
love.  Very few people really fall in love.  They
haven't got it in them.  It's a matter of pluck.
You've got it in you.  When you're in love, you'll
know it, and so will the girl, or I'm very much
mistaken."  She looked at Carstairs' steady eyes and
firm mouth with a sort of motherly admiration.
</p>

<p>
"I was nineteen then, and I met her quite by
accident."
</p>

<p>
"One always does," she interposed.
</p>

<p>
"I have not seen her since, except once, through
the window, and&mdash;well, it was very bad indeed for
some time after that."
</p>

<p>
She laughed.  "That's it.  That's it."  she said.
"How long ago was that?"
</p>

<p>
"About two years."
</p>

<p>
"And you still think of her?"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;occasionally."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Mr Carstairs, you're badly hit."  She leaned
towards him in an affectionate, motherly manner.
"You're badly hit," she grew pensive all of a sudden.
"It may be good, or it may be bad.  'Tis a Providence,
I suppose.  You know you're very selfish, Mr Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
"Me?  Mrs Darwen!"  Carstairs was amazed.
</p>

<p>
"You needn't be so surprised, it's a universal
masculine attribute.  Charlie can explain it, he
understands it."
</p>

<p>
"Result of heredity, relic of the chimpanzee,"
Darwen remarked casually.
</p>

<p>
"What is she like?  Handsome?" Mrs Darwen asked.
</p>

<p>
"Very; and full of pluck."
</p>

<p>
"Full of pluck!  Ah!" she gave a deep sigh.
"They feel it most, always."  She seemed very sad
all of a sudden.  "What's that bit of poetry, Charlie,
about the strongest and the wisest, you know."
</p>

<p>
  "Is it true, O Christ in Heaven, that the wisest suffer most,<br>
  That the strongest wander farthest, and most hopelessly are lost."<br>
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>
"That's it.  You're very strong, Mr Carstairs.
Brutal almost, and wise."
</p>

<p>
"I should like to be, but I'm afraid I'm rather weak
and silly at times."
</p>

<p>
She gazed at him steadily with a puzzled air.
"You're different," she said, "you're not like the men
of my generation.  Are you a horseman?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm an engineer."
</p>

<p>
"That's the difference, I expect.  It's a new type to
me."
</p>

<p>
Darwen swung round on his music stool.  "It's
a new type to the world, mater; a sort of thinking
machine, getting the human emotions thoroughly
under control; the horseman was a sort of embryo
engineer, he utilised the forces of nature according
to his lights, but he was essentially a passionate man,
he opposed his will to the brute's will.  The engineer
has to do with inanimate lumps of metal, and it's
no use hitting them.  Have you ever observed,
Carstairs, the old type of fitter let go with his hammer
at a job that's baffling him, the younger generation
is much less so, he thinks.  Nowadays every one
is becoming more or less of an engineer, and it's
good, it makes necessary a higher standard of
intelligence, of self-reliance, and self-control.  The
nation of the future is the nation with the best
engineers."
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me," Mrs Darwen remarked, "that
you are substituting a coldly brutal type for a passionately
brutal type.  Men are very much nearer animals
than women."
</p>

<p>
"The engineer has also to deal with men as well as
engines, which has a humanizing effect on him, Mrs
Darwen," Carstairs said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes!  Fortunately Providence has provided a
safety valve for his pent up emotions; you can't
possibly imagine the intense mental relief of growling
at a stoker because the steam's low, when it's not
really the man's fault at all."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs laughed.  "I rather like stokers myself,
they're a rough and ready crowd, they'd knock you
down for the price of a drink.  And the
language&mdash;Shakespeare isn't in it."
</p>

<p>
"They do swear, but if you think a minute you'll
admit that the average stoker isn't in it with the
average engineer; it's the same as everything else,
it takes brains and feelings to swear well."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if women will ever be engineers."
</p>

<p>
"My dear mater!  Women are the finest engineers
in the world now, they engineer us poor men, first
to the altar, then to the graveyard or to the
work-house.  Men run engines, business, etc., women run
men.  The world is run by women, not by men.  I
remember talking to a stoker once about matrimony.
'It's alright for a change,' he said, 'but it ain't no use
permanent.'  I suggested that a little kindness
might improve matters.  ''Taint no use,' he said.
I then ventured the opinion that to go home drunk
and break up the furniture, sometimes has a
conciliatory effect.  ''Taint no use,' he repeated again.
'Stop supplies for a bit,' I suggested.  ''Taint no use,'
he repeated.  'Well, clear out.'  ''Taint no use,' he
answered.  'I've stayed home and helped 'em in the
house, I've give 'em all my pay.  I've come home
drunk and broke things, I've chucked boiling water
over 'em, and beat 'em with the poker, but ''tain't no
use,' he shook his head with infinite sadness, 'you
always gets had,' he said.  He was a thoughtful,
intelligent sort of man, and he'd had three wives, so
he ought to know."
</p>

<p>
Mrs Darwen laughed.  "He was a thorough sort
of man, anyway, and women like a thorough man."
</p>

<p>
"So do men, Mrs Darwen.  Personally my daily
prayer is to be preserved from the wishy-washy fool
who does what he's told in unquestioning obedience."
</p>

<p>
"Listen to the Saxon expounding his creed, mater.
'Oh God, give me some one to have a row with.'"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs smiled.  "If you'd lived in Scotland you'd
know that the first thing the Scotch working man does
is to flatly contradict you to your face; then he argues
the point, if you let him.  The Scotchman is naturally
mathematical, he is not willing to accept your word
that you're the boss, he wants proof.  I like the
Scotch."
</p>

<p>
"They offer unlimited possibilities of a row."
</p>

<p>
"I don't like rows; I like to appeal to a man's
reason."
</p>

<p>
Darwen drove one fist with a bang into the palm of
his other hand.  "The logic of the Englishman,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"It seems to me that's the bed rock of all logic.
I think that it was you who told me that Herbert
Spencer and Ruskin both arrived at the same
conclusion."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I did; I forget.  But anyway, all of you
people make the mistake of dividing people into types,
classes and creeds.  'Nature recognizes neither
kingdoms nor classes, no orders, no genera, no
sub-genera, nature recognizes nothing but
individuals.'  That's Lamarck."
</p>

<p>
"Is it?  Well, I hope he won't do it again, because
he upsets all your elaborate theories about Saxons,
Celts, and so on."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all; he doesn't say that they don't run in
types, that large classes and races of men are not as
like as two peas in almost all respects, he simply says
that nature makes no effort to preserve them as they
are, or, because of their numbers, to save them from
annihilation.  A whole class, a whole creed, or a whole
race may exist simply for the benefit, and to assist
in the development of, one individual, and when he
ceases to have need of them, puff! they are wiped out."
</p>

<p>
"A creed formerly known as Kingcraft, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  'The King can do no wrong' simply
means that if he does wrong, he ceases to be a king,
and the only proof that he has done wrong is the fact
that he has failed to keep his crown.  That is the
teaching of old Nick, and personally I expand the
theorem to embrace all humanity, every man should
be a little king unto himself.  That is to say, he must
use his brains and control his passions."
</p>

<p>
Mrs Darwen sighed.  "The inward passions are
sometimes the voice of God, and sometimes the voice
of the Devil," she said.
</p>

<p>
"There you are! and how are you to distinguish?
Tennyson tells us that 'doubt is devil-born,' and
certainly constant doubt and hesitation play the devil
with a man's mind and body.  My theory is 'never
analyse an impulse.  Act on it with the best
conjunction of your reason.'  Here's old Carstairs,
analysing, theorizing, vacillating, hesitating as to
whether he's in love or not."
</p>

<p>
Mrs Darwen stood up.  "It's hard to say which
is best," she said.  "You're like, and yet very unlike,
your father, Charlie."  She went over to a small
table and picked up a large album.  "Have you ever
seen Charlie's father, Mr Carstairs?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't think I have."  He took the volume
on his knees, and she leaned over his shoulder as he
turned the pages.
</p>

<p>
Darwen swung round again on his stool and played
low, soft music on the piano.
</p>

<p>
"There!  That's me when I was a girl," she said,
arresting Carstairs' hand.
</p>

<p>
He looked closely and intently at a full length
portrait of a remarkably handsome and well built
girl, dressed in a riding habit, sitting on a saddle.
The features were clear-cut and regular, nothing harsh
and nothing coarse; the mouth was firm, and the eyes
bold and defiant.  It seemed the portrait of a happy,
rollicking tom-boy.  The resemblance to the woman
at his side seemed rather faint.
</p>

<p>
"You were beautiful," he said, "that's the type
I admire."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! well, perhaps not a beauty, but I was usually
considered good looking."
</p>

<p>
On the opposite page was a tall man, handsome,
big-nosed, but he seemed deficient in chin.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs looked at him closely for some time.
"He's handsome too.  Not very much like Charlie,
and yet&mdash;the face seems familiar.  I seem somehow
to have met that man, sort of family resemblance to
Charlie, I suppose.  You cannot say that any
individual feature is like, and yet&mdash;you know.  Was
he musical?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh very.  He had a music degree, at Oxford,
you know."
</p>

<p>
"Had he really?  A sort of brilliant, all round man,
like Charlie."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the little gong sounded outside in the
hall, and Mrs Darwen stood up.  "There's dinner.
Let's go in," she moved out, and they followed.
</p>

<p>
Darwen sat down opposite Carstairs, he caught hold
of his chin with both hands.  "Old Carstairs gave me
such a whack on the jaw that I'm afraid he's jammed
the hinges, mater.  I hope you've got something nice
and not tough.  How's the new maid?  Hullo!"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs had half risen from his chair and stood
staring like a man transfixed.  Following the direction
of his gaze, Darwen's eyes rested for the first time on
his mother's new maid who was bringing in the dinner.
She was tall and beautifully proportioned, every
movement showed a lissome supple grace, and the
features were equal to anything he had ever seen
carved in marble; the jet black hair and deep brown
eyes gave him the clue.  This was Carstairs' gipsy
maid.
</p>

<p>
Her face was the colour of a boiled beet as she bent
down and placed a dish in front of Mrs Darwen.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs watched her for a minute with a sort of
amazed frown.  Her colour faded to the normal
again, and as she raised her head she looked into his
eyes for a second without a vestige of recognition.
</p>

<p>
Darwen observed them both, his eyes were
supernaturally bright.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs subsided into his chair and bent over his
soup.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Darwen glanced from one to the other and
glanced at the maid.  Then she smiled.
</p>

<p>
The conversation went on in spasmodic jerks till
the maid left the room.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think I've got a nice-looking maid, Mr
Carstairs?"
</p>

<p>
"I do.  In fact she's the girl I was telling you about."
</p>

<p>
"I thought so, the fates arrange these things.
She's lovely; I thought when I was engaging her
that it was a good job Charlie was shortly going to
get married."
</p>

<p>
"You're mistaken, mater.  Charlie is not shortly
going to get married."
</p>

<p>
"Not!  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"It's broken off."
</p>

<p>
"You haven't jilted her, Charlie?"
</p>

<p>
"No, dear mater, she's jilted me."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense."
</p>

<p>
"Well, she broke it off.  You see&mdash;you remember
that girl at the diggings, Carstairs, I used to give her
a few music lessons and that sort of thing.  Well,
she got hold of Isabel and told her all about it; of
course I couldn't deny it.  It seemed to me she took
a very narrow-minded view of it.  So we broke off
the engagement.  Anyway, I could never have run
smoothly with her, besides, the old Doctor's too much
of an autocrat."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! but you could have pacified her surely,
she'll forget that."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid not, mater.  The more we talked, the
further apart we seemed to get.  I said I was sorry
and all that, but this has been coming on for some
time.  We haven't been hitting it at all well for
months past."
</p>

<p>
Mrs Darwen and Carstairs were silent.
</p>

<p>
"As a matter of fact," Darwen proceeded, "I'm
getting sick of this place and all the people in it, I
want a change.  Your people were good enough to
ask me to come and see them whenever I liked.  Do
you think they could put me up next week-end,
Carstairs?  I like having a chat with your guv'nor.
I must admit I'm rather sick over this
business&mdash;disappointed, you know.  I had built up an
idol&mdash;you don't understand these things, Carstairs.  If I
stopped to think now I should feel suicidal."
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk nonsense, my boy.  Can't you and Mr
Carstairs go away for the week end?"
</p>

<p>
"Not together, mater, we mustn't both leave the
works.  If Carstairs' people could do with me for the
week end&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I can understand these things better than you
think, Darwen.  The people will be very pleased to
see you, I know."  Carstairs was very sober.  "The
feminine mind is incomprehensible."
</p>

<p>
Mrs Darwen leaned over towards him.  "I'll help
you, Mr Carstairs.  Come and spend Sunday with me
when Charlie's away.  Perhaps if I called on Isabel,
Charlie&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You can't restore a shattered idol, mater.  It's
my fault, I know, but a fellow expects&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Everything," Mrs Darwen said sadly, "and some
women give it, ah! yes, some women give it."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
</h3>

<p>
A few days later, the inquest on the man who
had been killed at the works was held.
Darwen gave evidence that he was going up to tell
the man to be more careful as he had just dropped
an iron bar, when he tried to get up on his feet and
slipped off the plank.  Several men who had been
working there at the time corroborated his evidence,
and a verdict of 'accidental death' was brought
in&mdash;with a censure on the foreman for allowing an
intoxicated man to go up on high scaffolding.
</p>

<p>
Councillor Donovan met Darwen afterwards.  "You
seem to be having a run of bad luck, Mr Darwen."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, we have been rather unfortunate lately;
still 'tis a Providence' you know, Mr Donovan.
If men will get drunk&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Sure!  Yes!  Will you come and have a whisky
yourself, Mr Darwen?"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, I will."
</p>

<p>
They adjourned to a saloon bar near.
</p>

<p>
"You're puttin' down a lot of plant, Mr Darwen,
making quite a new place of it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the old stuff is quite inadequate for our
increasing load," Darwen leaned forward confidentially
and spoke very low.  "Do you know, Mr Donovan,
I'm bringing to light some very funny things in these
works."
</p>

<p>
"You don't say&mdash;"  Mr Donovan's eyes were wide
and his cheek was pale.
</p>

<p>
"Between ourselves, I've got almost clear proof
that a considerable number of men who didn't exist
were drawing regular weekly pay, and the plant&mdash;"
he shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"Never!  Mr Darwen."
</p>

<p>
"Not a word!  I don't want to make a scandal,
but I can't have any unpleasantness on the council,
so! of course, if it becomes necessary in self defence&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"True for ye.  True for ye."
</p>

<p>
"I want a friend on the council, Mr Donovan.
I've broken off my engagement with Dr Jameson's
daughter&mdash;and there's no knowing how he'll take it.
I must have a friend, a really stalwart friend, or else
I shall perhaps be compelled to take unpleasant action,
which would be very regrettable, very regrettable
indeed I'm going to apply for a rise, a £100 rise."
</p>

<p>
"Ye'll have a friend, Mr Darwen, a rale good friend.
I can promise ye that."
</p>

<p>
They walked out together and down the street;
they stopped at the corner where their ways divided.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, Mr Donovan.  I'm going away on
Saturday to spend a week-end with my friend, the
Vicar of Chilcombe, on the Cotswold Hills, you know.
My nerves are rather run down, unpleasant incidents
seem to be dogging me; the air there is very fine,
I shall take some good country walks."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! ye need a rest.  Ye've been working very
hard, Mr Darwen.  And may the devil take ye,"
Mr Donovan added under his breath as he turned
away.
</p>

<p>
Similar interviews Darwen had that day with
several other councillors, and impressed on them all
that he needed a friend on the council.  Two days
later he left for Chilcombe; Carstairs saw him off.
"Remember me to all the people," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I will, old chap, and you'll hustle 'em on with the
work, won't you?"
</p>

<p>
They shook hands cordially.
</p>

<p>
On Sunday Carstairs called on Mrs Darwen.  She
was watching for him at the window, and came out
to open the door herself.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mr Carstairs, she's gone, she left last night."
</p>

<p>
"Gone!" Carstairs repeated with a disappointment
he made no endeavour to conceal.
</p>

<p>
"A small boy came and called her away to her
people.  They're encamped about ten miles away from
here, and her mother is very ill."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs sat down.  "Her mother," he repeated
absently.  "That old gipsy woman, the Queen of the
gipsies, she told my fortune, no, it was the kid.  She
said, 'You're a winner, you'll always win.'  Lord,
I haven't won much yet.  I'm too slow.  Mrs Darwen,
I shall have to hustle."
</p>

<p>
She watched him with sympathy and admiration.
He wasn't knocked down, he was spurred to further
energy; she liked that sort, it was the breed she was
used to&mdash;the thorough bred.
</p>

<p>
"Where is this place, Mrs Darwen?  I'll walk over
there to-day."
</p>

<p>
"It's over by the new water works.  I forget the
name of the place."
</p>

<p>
"Dash it!  I can't go to-day, and leave the works
while Charlie's away."
</p>

<p>
"Would it really matter?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Probably not, but you never can tell, and he asked
me not to leave."
</p>

<p>
"You know, Mr Carstairs, Charlie has got a very
true friend and assistant in you; he thinks a lot of
you, he told me that you had done more towards
making the works pay than any man."
</p>

<p>
"Charlie's a jolly good sort, Mrs Darwen!  We were
chums from the start.  He's given me a tremendous
leg up too."
</p>

<p>
She smiled with infinite pleasure; she could listen
to such remarks all day long.  "I don't like his being
mixed up with that lodging-house girl, though.  Do
you know her?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see her once or twice a day when she brings
in the grub and that sort of thing.  She seems alright.
You know, Charlie's such a handsome chap that the
girls won't leave him alone."
</p>

<p>
Mrs Darwen smiled again, then sighed.  "His
father was the same," she said.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs changed the subject.  "What do you think
of your maid, Mrs Darwen?"
</p>

<p>
"She's superbly handsome."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she's improved.  She knows it too, I think."
</p>

<p>
"She'd be a fool if she didn't; the postman, the
butcher's boy, the milkman and all the lot are simply
wild about her."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs frowned unconsciously.
</p>

<p>
"But she takes no notice of them.  I sit and watch
them at this window.  It's very amusing.  They try
all their time-honoured wiles, whistling and winking,
etc.  She quells them easily.  The butcher boy
blushed as red as a piece of his own beef.  She's
got quite the drawing-room manner."
</p>

<p>
"Why did she leave Lady Cleeve's, do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"She gave no explanation, simply that she wanted
to leave.  She has exceptional characters."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs frowned again.  "Dash it!  It does jar
on one."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it does, but no man need ever be
ashamed of that girl.  She speaks perfectly correct
English."
</p>

<p>
"She did before, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, I rather believe she has some idea
of going on the stage."
</p>

<p>
"On the stage!  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, she reads Shakespeare and she sings very
well indeed."
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;have you heard her?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes.  I asked her to come into the drawing-room
one evening, bearing in mind her possible relation
to you, you know.  Charlie says she's very highly
gifted that way, and he's going to give her a little
instruction on the piano."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stood up suddenly.  "Charlie and I are
going to quarrel," he said with a little laugh, but his
eyes flashed fire.  He sat down as promptly as he had
got up.
</p>

<p>
She came over and put a hand on his arm; she was
very serious.  "You don't like that business of the
lodging-house gin, any more than I do.  I shall make
a point of always being in the room when Charlie's
teaching her."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs looked gloomily at the carpet.  "Charlie's
such a handsome chap, he plays and sings and does
everything so well; he's got all the luck."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him very sadly.  "You're a better
man than Charlie, Mr Carstairs.  I'm his mother,
and it goes to my heart to say it, but I can't help it.
I suppose I spoilt him.  He's had his own way so
much.  I shall tell that girl so, it if seems necessary."
</p>

<p>
"It's no use, Mrs Darwen."
</p>

<p>
"You won't quarrel with Charlie, Mr Carstairs?"
</p>

<p>
He sat silent.  "I can't promise," he said after a
pause.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I was afraid so.  The only friend he's got,
the only chum he ever had; plenty of acquaintances,
but no friends, no real friends.  Don't you quarrel
with him, Mr Carstairs, please don't.  I feel you do
him so much good, I know it, he says so himself and
I'm afraid he'll get wild and go to the bad.  Promise
me you'll always be his friend."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stood up and looked steadily into her eyes.
"I can't promise, Mrs Darwen, because I may not
be able to keep it, but I'll try."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" she said, "if only Charlie were like you."
</p>

<p>
"When is she coming back?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow, she said, but I told her not to hurry
if her mother were really ill."
</p>

<p>
"Can you send her out somewhere&mdash;say to the
general post office, at eight o'clock in the evening.
I'll meet her and tackle her alone."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I will, at eight o'clock."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks very much," he said, and took up his hat
to go.
</p>

<p>
"You'll not say anything to Charlie&mdash;yet?"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stopped to consider.  He liked to have
everything above board; this secrecy rather savoured
of double dealing to him.
</p>

<p>
"No-o," he said at length.  "I shall tell him as
soon as I get an opportunity that I'm going to make
the running with that girl if I can."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you can, I know you can."
</p>

<p>
"By the way, what's her name?"
</p>

<p>
"Darkey&mdash;Edith Darkey."
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord, what a name!"
</p>

<p>
"The relic of a nickname, I expect.  She may not
really be a gipsy at all."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps not.  It doesn't matter anyway."  He
shook hands and left.  He went down to the works
and sat in the little watch office chatting with the shift
engineer for half an hour, then he strolled round and
looked at engines and boilers and had a few words
with stokers and engine-drivers.  Sunday in an electricity
generating station is a particularly doleful time;
when half the place is dark and three quarters of the
plant idle, and the staff, a mere ghost of its normal
week-day number; when men with unusually clean
hands and faces and a general semi-Sunday appearance
flit silent and spectre-like across the dreary, empty
engine-room, and silent, idle machines cast uncanny
shadows in the unlighted parts of the building.  It
was rather pleasant to Carstairs, as he wandered round,
to contemplate the bad old days when he himself used
to be tied by the leg as it were, to this place for eight
hours at a time.  He was just going out when he almost
ran into Mr Donovan and another councillor, resplendent
in frock coats, white waistcoats and silk hats.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Mr Carstairs, is Mr Darwen about?"
</p>

<p>
"No, he's gone away for a week-end."
</p>

<p>
"Is he now!  That's disappointing, we'll just have
a look round anyway.  Ye might come with us and
explain, Mr Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;yes.  Certainly."
</p>

<p>
Mr Donovan became enthusiastic.  "He's a clever
chap is Mr Darwen, a wonderful clever chap.  Look
at this, Mr Jenkins" (as Carstairs switched on the arc
light in the new part).  "An' all out of his own head.
Ah! he's a clever chap.  We mustn't lose him, Mr
Jenkins."
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed, Mr Donovan."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! an' is that the place where the poor fellow
was killed?"
</p>

<p>
"Well!  Well!  Indeed now, Mr Donovan, the
Lord takes us all in His own good time."
</p>

<p>
"True for ye.  An' Mr Darwen tried to save him,
so he did.  Look at this, Mr Jenkins! engine beds,
see! one, two, three.  Three new engines, is it,
Mr Carstairs?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed now!  Three!  It's a lot of work for one
man, too."
</p>

<p>
"So it is, Mr Jenkins, an' he deserves more pay
for the doing of it."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed and he does, Mr Donovan."
</p>

<p>
So they went on these two Celts, the small built,
swarthy, insidious, oily Welshman, and the brawny,
hearty, crafty Irishman; till Carstairs felt an actual
physical nausea creeping over him.  He had drawn
out most of these plans himself, working night and
day, calculating, measuring, thinking.  And Darwen
was going to get a rise.  Darwen who had done
nothing but stick out for considerably larger engines
than Carstairs thought necessary.  Darwen who had
everything and was even now ensnaring the only girl
that Carstairs ever cared for.  Jack Carstairs with the
great, big, English heart, felt really sick.
</p>

<p>
At last they went and Carstairs wished them good-night
at the door.  Shortly after he walked home alone
by himself, ruminating on many things.
</p>

<p>
Next day Darwen returned late in the afternoon.
He could read Carstairs like a book, and as he shook
hands he saw that something was on his friend's mind.
</p>

<p>
"What's up, Carstairs?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I called on your mater yesterday, and the girl
was gone."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, the new servant!"  Carstairs noted that
Darwen was really interested.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the new servant.  I intend to marry that
girl, if she'll have me."
</p>

<p>
"Do you really?  It'll rather wreck your prospects
in this town.  I mean to say, I shan't be staying very
much longer, I expect."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, rats to this town, I'm sick of it anyway.
But why are you going to leave just when you're
going to get a rise?"
</p>

<p>
"How do you know I am going to get a rise?"
</p>

<p>
"Donovan and Jenkins were in here last night,
and I gathered so from their remarks."
</p>

<p>
"Aha!  Mr Donovan, was he?  Come on down
to old Donovan's pub and have a drink and see me
chaff him, he can't for the life of him make out what's
become of the hired assassin he sent to shoot me.
Do you know, I often wonder what would become of
'em if they brought off the event."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was moody.  "Why are you going to
leave just when your mater's got settled?"
</p>

<p>
"Dear boy, I want more money.  The maximum
of this job is about £500 or £600 per annum.  You
don't imagine that's going to hold me!  I want a rise
simply as a testimonial, don't you see?  London's my
place!  One of the big London jobs is what I'm after.
Get your hat and come on down to old Donovan's pub,
and I'll tell you all the news about your people as
we go."
</p>

<p>
Silently Carstairs got his hat and they went down
the street together.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I had a jolly good time," Darwen started.
"One of your brothers was home&mdash;Stanley.  He's
going in for the law, isn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; been going in for it a long time now."
</p>

<p>
"Is that so?  It's a long job, the law.  Anyway,
they were all very fit and well.  Your mater was very
sympathetic over my engagement being broken off.
I saw the Bevengtons.  Jolly decent girl that
Bevengton girl.  Can't understand why you don't
fix it up there."
</p>

<p>
"I explained the reason just now."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so, so you did.  By the way, the girl's not
gone away altogether, has she?"
</p>

<p>
"No, her mother's ill, be back to-day possibly."  Carstairs
was watching him closely and he saw the
old, old light that he knew flicker up into Darwen's
eyes.
</p>

<p>
They reached Councillor Donovan's hotel: a not
very high class place near the docks.  Darwen called
for drinks.  "Is Mr Donovan about?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You might tell him that some one would like to
speak to him, will you?"
</p>

<p>
"What name, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Darwen paused.  "Er&mdash;Carstairs," he said.  Carstairs
looked at his chief in questioning surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Wait a minute," Darwen said in answer to his
look.  "Keep your eyes wide open and your mouth
shut."
</p>

<p>
Next minute Mr Donovan appeared, jovial and
hearty, his waistcoat of many colours expanded to its
utmost limit.  He stopped dead and turned a sickly
light purple hue when he caught sight of Darwen.
He pulled himself together in an instant, however,
and advanced with outstretched hand.  "How do
you do?  I thought it was Mr Carstairs."  Surprise
and apprehension were still in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Darwen took him by the hand and smiled into his
face, his delightful, winning smile.  "What are you
going to have, Mr Donovan?  Whisky?  Have a
brandy, you don't seem quite up to the mark.  Sit
down, my dear chap."  He pushed him into a chair
facing them.  "That's better; you were surprised
to see me, Mr Donovan?"
</p>

<p>
"Pleased, Mr Darwen; I'm always pleased to see
a friend."
</p>

<p>
"That's like you, Mr Donovan.  Here's your
health, your very good health, and may you live a
very long time and be very happy."
</p>

<p>
"Same to you, Mr Darwen, and you, Mr Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs raised his glass without a word.
</p>

<p>
Darwen carefully wiped his small, neat moustache
with a snowy white pocket handkerchief.  "I had a
most pleasant week-end, but&mdash;" he leaned confidentially
forward across the little round table&mdash;"Now,
don't be alarmed, Carstairs&mdash;it was marred by
a somewhat unpleasant incident."  He paused and
looked at Mr Donovan in silence for about half a
minute.  Carstairs watched them both, calmly
observant.  Darwen took another drink.  Mr Donovan
seemed in painful suspense.
</p>

<p>
"Ye're not hurt, are ye?" he blurted out at
length.
</p>

<p>
"Me!  Mr Donovan?  Oh no, not a scratch.  But
they found a poor devil under my window, your
window, Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
"Get on wid yer story, man!  What was the matter
with him?"
</p>

<p>
Darwen turned to Carstairs.  "He was a red-headed
man, a sailor or marine fireman.  Lord knows how
he came to get up there among the sheep and the
shepherds."
</p>

<p>
"But what was the matter with him?"
</p>

<p>
"He was dead!"  Darwen looked Mr Donovan
steadily in the eyes.  "His ribs were crushed in like
an egg shell, and his neck was broken."
</p>

<p>
"Good God!  Did he fall from the roof, or what?"
</p>

<p>
"Well!"  Darwen shrugged his shoulders.  "It
seemed almost as though he had been hugged by a
polar bear.  In fact, that's the local theory, that he
had a performing bear or animal of some sort which
turned on him.  They are searching the woods now;
there's quite a reign of terror in the neighbourhood."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stood up.  "I say, I think I had better
run home and see the old people."
</p>

<p>
Darwen caught him by the coat and pulled him into
his seat.  "It's alright, old chap, your brother's there,
and they've got a lot of extra police from Gloucester and
other places."  Carstairs sat down again with an
undecided air.  He hadn't much confidence in his brother.
</p>

<p>
"It's alright; he's got a gun and a heavy service
revolver, and Lord knows what."  Darwen was speaking
to Carstairs about his brother.  He always admired
the superb confidence Carstairs had in himself; he
placed no reliance on other people.  He still seemed
unsatisfied.  "Look here, old chap, I'm convinced
that your old people will be alright."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs considered.  "The guv'nor can take care
of himself as a rule," he said thoughtfully, "and
Stanley's alright, but too theoretical&mdash;you can't
theorise with bears.  I say, we can spare Bounce for a
few days; I'll stand the expense and send him over
with a revolver to sleep in the house for a bit.  He
can drive in tin tacks at twenty yards&mdash;and I've seen
Bounce on breakdowns."  He seemed quite relieved
and sat down again in peace.
</p>

<p>
"Who's Bounce?" Mr Donovan asked with interest.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, an engine driver at the works."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  Mr Donovan made a mental note of the
name and address of the man who could drive in tin
tacks at twenty yards.
</p>

<p>
Darwen took a drink.  "This is the third occasion
on which I have had a narrow escape of my life!" he
observed.
</p>

<p>
Mr Donovan started like a frightened horse.  "What
do you mean?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I'm a great believer in luck, that's all.  A new
servant of my mother's, a gipsy girl, told my fortune
the other day.  'You'll have several exciting
adventures, but you'll always be very lucky,' she said."
</p>

<p>
"She told me I should always be a winner," Carstairs
remarked.
</p>

<p>
Mr Donovan looked from one to the other.  He
was very superstitious himself, but he didn't know
whether they were in jest or earnest.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Darwen continued, "this is the third and
last attempt.  There'll be no more."  He rose and
held out his hand with a smile.
</p>

<p>
Mr Donovan's face was like a lump of dough.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," Darwen said, "I was forgetting
what I came for.  Carstairs is putting in for a rise too,
a £50 rise.  I suppose I can rely on your assistance,
Mr Donovan?"
</p>

<p>
"Ye can that, Mr Darwen."  A little colour came
back into his face.  "The meeting's on Wednesday,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
Outside Darwen clapped Carstairs on the back.
"There you are, old chap!  Now we'll go and compose
your letter to the committee asking for a £50 rise."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks very much, but what's the bottom of this
devil's business, Darwen?  How was that man killed,
and why isn't that beast in there in prison?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear fellow, 'that beast' has got brains.  I
consider Donovan a distinctly clever man.  It's only
the fools who go to prison.  I wish you could come into
the committee to hear old Donovan speak, Irishmen
are born orators."  Darwen spoke quite affectionately.
They passed a policeman; he saluted Darwen
respectfully.
</p>

<p>
"Fine, big, brawny chap, isn't he?  Gets about
thirty shillings a week, and what he can pinch.  Truly
the English are a mighty people.  'Set a fool to catch
a fool.'  That man touches his hat to the rogues and
yanks honest simpletons off to gaol.  I can't
understand how you can be so wrapped up in simple,
silly engines, when these great, complicated human
machines called towns and cities are so vastly more
interesting.  They follow the same rules, it is well
to study engines before you study men: the
interdependence of parts, the distribution of stresses, and
the vast invisible force which you call steam or
electricity, and I call morals and sentiments.  I never cease
to wonder at the vastness and complexity of nature.

<p class="noindent">
Tennyson was essentially the modern poet.  Nature,
to him, meant the universe and the controller of the
universe.  So it does to me.  I'm what you would
call a truly religious man, Carstairs.  Life is full of
pleasure to me.  I very seldom feel what you call
anger.  My emotions are well under control.  The
misery of the world is due to uncontrolled emotion.
I had a most pleasant conversation with your guv'nor
and Dr Bevengton on Sunday about the same thing."  He
turned and faced Carstairs suddenly.  "You know
I was never really in love with Isabel Jameson: the
only way I could convince Pa, who was chairman of
the electricity committee, that I was a good engineer,
was by getting engaged to his daughter.  She was
simply a cog in the gearing that linked his intellect with
mine.  These things are necessary for universal peace."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so.  And you're going to marry Bessie
Bevengton for a similar reason."
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed.  "The Saxons used to fight with
sledge hammers," he said.  "They're still adept with
the weapon.  A woman is simply a ragged bundle of
emotions badly tied up, with the ends trailing out in all
directions, and it's those trailing ends that upset half
the world.  A man never loves as the men in books
do."
</p>

<p>
"I think your remark about the policeman touching
his hat to the rogues was most appropriate."
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed aloud.  "The Saxon could never
handle the rapier," he said.  "You're built for a
slogger, Carstairs, and I expect you'd break most
men's hearts at that game, but not mine, I can avoid
you, I'm too nimble.  Will you come home and spend
the evening with me?"
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks, not to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, you will, you're not busy."
</p>

<p>
"No, I have an engagement."
</p>

<p>
Darwen raised his eyebrows and shot a quick glance
at him.  He wondered whether Carstairs was trying
his prentice hand at lying.
</p>

<p>
"In that case of course&mdash;" he said, and they walked
back to the works in silence.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
</h3>

<p>
That evening Carstairs hung round the post
office from half-past seven to half-past eight,
he was thinking of going away when Mrs Darwen's
new maid turned the corner at the end of the street,
he waited under the big arc light outside the main
entrance.  As she came into the light, he stepped up
and raised his hat.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Miss Darkey," the name almost
stuck in his throat.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Mr Carstairs," she gave him a
polite bow.
</p>

<p>
"How is your mother?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Better, thank you."  She hardly seemed inclined
to stop.
</p>

<p>
"What was the matter?" he asked.  He was rather
at his wits' end for something to say to detain her.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," she answered.  She looked at him,
he thought, with a little amusement.  "We gipsies
never give names to our complaints.  It may have been
appendicitis, or fever, or a cold.  Mother took herb
tea, and she's better now."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad of that," he said and stuck.
</p>

<p>
She passed on into the post office.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm damned," he said to himself.  He was
beginning to lose his temper.  He watched her purchase
some stamps at the counter&mdash;her profile seemed even
better than her full face; the contemplation of her
beauty cast a spell over him, for once in his life
Carstairs felt rather hopeless.  She did not look like a
servant in her best clothes, but like a lady in poor
circumstances.  He noticed the obsequious civilities
of the clerk at the counter, and thought what a pitiful
ass the fellow was.  He stepped up to her again as she
came out, a little blaze of anger in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Look here!  What's the matter?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," she answered, gazing at him in cold
surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Well, why didn't you speak to me the other
evening?"  He was rather flabbergasted, he could
not realize that this was the meek little girl he had
known in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
She raised her eyebrows in mild surprise.  "It's
not usual for servants to speak to guests, unless they
are spoken to," she said.
</p>

<p>
"No, er&mdash;may I walk home with you?"  As he
looked into her eyes he thought for a moment, he saw
some resemblance to Darwen.
</p>

<p>
She hesitated a second, and he, watching closely,
caught the light of a little look that made him feel
very happy.  "Yes, if you like," she said, and just
for a moment the long black lashes swept the cheek
as he had seen them once before.
</p>

<p>
With much alacrity he stepped on to the off side,
and they proceeded down the street.
</p>

<p>
"You've changed wonderfully since I saw you last,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
"Have I?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Improved," he said, "wonderfully!  I had no
idea that much improvement was possible, but I see
it was."  Carstairs was not usually a man of many
words, yet that glimpse of the 'something' in her
eye seemed to have loosened his tongue.  He noticed
that she flushed slightly with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
"You're improved, too," she said, "you're older.
How's Miss Bevengton?"
</p>

<p>
They were just turning the corner.  A long vista
of electric lamps and lighted shops opened out before
their gaze.  He was just about to answer her question
(which had struck a jarring note) when the whole long
perspective of light suddenly became eclipsed, went
out, as if by magic.
</p>

<p>
"Confound it!  That's a breakdown at the works.
I shall have to go.  I'll put you on your road home,
and then, if you'll excuse me, I'll make a bee line for
the works."
</p>

<p>
"You need not trouble about me," she said.  "You
seem to forget that I piloted you through the woods
when you couldn't see your hand before your face."
</p>

<p>
He hesitated; the trouble at the works called to
him like a siren.  As a result of many years of habit,
other things seemed to fade into temporary
insignificance.
</p>

<p>
"Are you quite sure you don't mind?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Quite," she answered.
</p>

<p>
Something in her tone seemed to warn him, but he
didn't quite grasp the situation.  His brain seemed
clogged, the siren of groaning engines and flashing
fuses seemed to hold his mind enthralled.  He held
out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
She took it coldly.  "Good-bye," she said, and
turned and was swallowed up in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of the street Carstairs jumped into
a hansom and dashed up to the works shortly after
the breakdown had occurred.  He found the shift
engineer (a very young man with a very young
moustache) trying to do fourteen different things at
once, and incidentally, by vigorous tugging,
endangering the very existence of the moustache.  When a
breakdown happens at an electric lighting station,
it is the lot of the shift engineer to be called upon to
do fourteen different things at once.  In the first
place, various fools, in various parts of the town,
ring up on the telephone to tell him the lights are out:
as if he were not painfully aware of it at the start, for
it may be taken as an axiom, that when the lights are
out in the town, they are very much in in the works;
then the engine-drivers get flurried at the unusual
display of fireworks around their engines; the
switchboard attendant (who is usually a budding shift
engineer) makes a frantic grab for the wrong switch
and jerks it out, making confusion worse confounded;
then the stokers get excited because their boilers are
blowing off like to burst and they can't see the water
in them; and at the finish of all when the poor shift
(usually a very young man) is priding himself on getting
rather well out of a tight place, the chief (usually also
a very young man) rings up to ask why in thunder he
did not do something altogether different, or why he
did not do what he did in much quicker time, or else
waits till next morning and harshly asks why the
shift engineer had not arrived, in a small fraction of a
minute, at the same idea of what was best, that he,
the chief, had, after a night's rest and a few hours'
consideration.
</p>

<p>
When Carstairs arrived the very young man in
question had just decided to cut all the other thirteen
things and stick to the one vital point.  He was getting
another machine ready as Carstairs mounted the
switchboard steps.
</p>

<p>
"What are you going to do?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Pump juice into it," the very young man answered
with a little joyous gleam in his eyes.  'Pumping
juice into it' is theoretically a rotten way of treating
a fault, but practically the act operates as a soothing
balm to the troubled and revengeful soul of the junior
engineer.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs, although a capable and careful engineer,
was very youthful himself.  "Alright.  Let it go,"
he said.  "Old Farrell will take all night to locate
it probably, otherwise."
</p>

<p>
So they "pumped juice into it" for some time, and
burnt out several yards of expensive cable, till almost
simultaneously with the mains superintendent and his
gang of disreputable looking labourers, a policeman
arrived to report "smoke issuing from between the
paving stones at the corner of High Street."
</p>

<p>
"There you are!" Carstairs said, triumphantly.
"There's your fault accurately located for you right
away.  I don't know what you mains chaps want
Wheatstone Bridges and Potentiometers, etc., for."
</p>

<p>
"It's all very well," grumbled Farrell.  "But who
is going to locate the other faults you've started in
the process."
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap, you must do something for your living."
</p>

<p>
The mains superintendent grunted, and went away.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs got on the station "bike," and cycled
out to Darwen's.  The cook opened the door to him.
He was rather disappointed, but he did not dwell on
it long.  He was ushered into the drawing-room.
He shook hands with Mrs Darwen.
</p>

<p>
"Breakdown in High Street," he announced bluntly.
</p>

<p>
Darwen was sitting at the piano, he had swung round
to face Carstairs as he entered.  "Hurray!" he
answered in an unemotional voice at the announcement
of the news.
</p>

<p>
"I was just turning the corner of High Street
with&mdash;a friend."  He caught Mrs Darwen's eye as he
hesitated slightly on the word, she smiled delighted
approval.  Darwen's eyes gave a little flicker from
his mother to Carstairs, and unnoticed, he smiled,
ever so slightly, too: Carstairs continued.  "I had
just turned the corner when the lights went out.
I&mdash;er&mdash;jumped into a hansom&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mrs Darwen looked at him in pained surprise, so
that he stopped in wonder.
</p>

<p>
"What about your friend?" Darwen asked, and
his eyes were very bright.
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;er&mdash;I left her in the street."  For three
generations or more, the Carstairs had spoken the
truth (mostly), this, the youngest scion of the sturdy
old stock, could not easily bend to deception.
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed aloud.  "Carstairs has got a girl,
mater," he said with much amusement.  "He was
just regaling her with a little light converse about
volts and engines when the lights went out, and he
forgot all about the girl, and hurried off to the
works."  He paused and looked from his mother to Carstairs
with brilliant sparkling eyes.  "What's her name,
Carstairs?"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs looked helplessly at Mrs Darwen and
remained silent.
</p>

<p>
She looked perplexed, angry, and sorrowful, all
at once.
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed again.  "Oh, mater!" he said.
"I didn't think it of you!  Accessory before and after
the fact.  Aiding and abetting old Carstairs to break
a poor girl's heart: he was getting on so nicely too,
just about to propose, when something distracted
his attention and he forgot all about it, and the girl
and everything else, so that she came in here half way
between tears and chucking the pots and pans about.
And now, two hours afterwards, old Carstairs turns
up to finish the remark he was about to make.  And
it's lucky for you, old chap, that she's not in, because
she'd either have gazed at you as if you were an
unclean reptile, or else she'd have chucked the furniture
at you."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs sat down limply.  "Has she gone away
again?" he asked helplessly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  The same boy came and fetched her, her
mother is worse.  She thinks nothing of walking ten
miles across country at this time of night.  I offered
to pay for a cab or something, but she wouldn't hear
of it."
</p>

<p>
"That's very kind of you, Mrs Darwen.  D'you&mdash;d'you
think she was really offended?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course she was.  I passed her in the hall as
she came in, but don't let that worry you, old chap.
The course of true love never did run smooth, you know
if there were none of these little obstructions and full
stops and side issues, the real thing would never be
awakened.  You may take it as an axiom that if a
girl never feels she'd like to chuck the fire-irons at you,
she doesn't care tuppence about you; at least, that
sort, with those eyebrows and eyes, and that free,
swinging carriage.  I'm in love with that girl myself."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs sighed somewhat heavily.  "Then you'd
better get out of love as soon as you can," he said,
with a little laugh, "or we shall fight.  I begin to
appreciate the spirit of the duelling age, I think it
would give me real pleasure to scrap with somebody
just now."  He laughed again, but there was a gleam
in his eyes that both Darwen and his mother noticed.
Darwen's face lighted up with appreciation, but his
mother looked very sad.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder how this shut-down will affect our
chances of a rise?" Carstairs remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's alright, old chap.  I have so many good
friends on the council now, that I'm not a bit afraid:
There's going to be a duel between old Donovan and
the doctor.  It'll be rather good, I expect, pity you
can't come to see the fun: they're going to rebel
against the iron rule of Dr Jameson, the whole council
is sick of his autocracy.  Donovan will open the ball
with a sledge-hammer attack; Jenkins will back him
up with some nasty hits below the belt; the old
Doctor will roar like a bull in pain, but I think he'll
be beaten this time.  I shall enjoy it anyway."
</p>

<p>
He swung round to the piano again, and dashed
into a lively waltz tune.  "That's the first dance I
ever danced with Isabel Jameson," he said over his
shoulder.  "This is ours, I believe!"  "Thanks very
much."  "Very nice floor."  "Yes."  "Rotten
weather!" etc., etc., he quoted, laughing lightly.
"Then, three months later, behind those imitation
palms at the foot of the stairs, to the strains of this
tune in the distance (he changed to a very slow dreamy
waltz) I proposed to her.  If it hadn't been for this
tune, I shouldn't have done it that night.  But it
was so appropriate, the opportunity seemed unique,
so I spoke up.  Isabel, (I never really cared for the
name of Isabel, you know), Isabel, may I call you
Isabel?  I love you.  Then&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His mother stepped up behind him and put her hand
on his shoulder.  "Hush, Charlie!  You don't know
what you're saying."
</p>

<p>
"I assure you, mater, I remember it quite distinctly.
It was one of the most exciting events&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My boy, the girl's going round the town looking
like a shadow since the engagement was broken off."
</p>

<p>
"Is she?  I'm very sorry, I haven't seen her."  He
seemed thoughtful for a minute.  "She was alright,
you know, jolly decent in fact, but we could never
have paired&mdash;she was silly.  There is a Providence,
mater.  ''Tis better to have loved and lost, than never
to have loved at all,' you know; these little afflictions
sort of temper our natures, accentuate and harden
the good qualities we possess."
</p>

<p>
"And the bad."
</p>

<p>
"That's so, of course.  Good and bad, simply a
matter of opinion.  I'm an optimist, I see no bad in
the world, it's all good.  Carstairs there is a grumpy
old pessimist, he hasn't got time to smile, he's too
busy trying to decide what's good and bad, and
honest and dishonest, etc.  And he don't know at
the finish.  Comes round here trying to steal my girl
and talks about fighting when I expostulate with him.
I tell you the more you think about honesty, the more
fogged you get."
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap, in that respect I'm not fogged in
the least."
</p>

<p>
Darwen strode over to him and clapped him on the
shoulder, "Buck up then, and go in and win, I
surrender all rights.  Take a day off to-morrow and
drive over to this place in a cab.  Take a nice little
gold watch or something, as a peace offering.  Then,
if I were you, on the strict Q.T., I should give her a
punch in the eye; her ma'mas for generations past
were probably wooed that way, and it would appeal
to her in spite of herself."
</p>

<p>
His mother laughed and looked at Carstairs.
"Really I should go over if I were you."
</p>

<p>
"Can't go to-morrow," Carstairs said definitely.
"Got to see the test of that new engine."
</p>

<p>
Darwen drew himself up and threw out his chest
with mock gravity.  "I'm the chief, and I tell you
you can go."
</p>

<p>
"You can say what you like, I'm not going unless
you give me the sack."
</p>

<p>
"I'd do that for two pins.  Shall I, mater?"
</p>

<p>
"No, not now.  She'll be back in a few days."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps.  Oh, these consciences.  Thank God,
I haven't one."
</p>

<p>
His mother stood up and looked at him sorrowfully.
"I don't believe you have very much, Charlie, but
pray God you may get one."
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed.  "That's alright, mater.  I've
got a jolly good conscience, but I keep it in the
background," he said.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stood up and held out his hand to Mrs
Darwen.  "Good night.  I'm afraid I've kept you up."
</p>

<p>
"Oh no," she said.  "Drop in whenever you can."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, I will."  He went out into the night and
wended his way slowly home.  As he turned the corner
of the long tree-shaded street in which his diggings
were, a man sprang out of a shrubbery behind, and
rushed at him with a heavy bludgeon.  Carstairs,
lost in reverie, pivoted on his heels at the sound,
and ducking mechanically as the stick descended,
shot out a straight left for the man's face.  It was not
a heavy blow, but now thoroughly awakened, he
stepped in and followed up with a terrific right hand
drive on the chin.
</p>

<p>
He dropped like a log, and Carstairs bent over him,
looking into his face.  Even by the dim light of the
distant gas lamp, he recognised his old acquaintance
Sam Lee, the gipsy.  He was not knocked out, but
only partly dazed by the blow, and as Carstairs bent
over him, he suddenly lashed out with a huge
hobnailed boot and caught him a vicious kick in the
stomach.  Writhing in pain, Carstairs collapsed in
the gutter, helpless.
</p>

<p>
The gipsy staggered to his feet, and picking up his
bludgeon made towards him.  Just then a large,
dark form loomed suddenly into view round the corner.
A bull's-eye lantern flashed a sudden light on the scene,
and Sam Lee sprinted off down the road with a
particularly limping shuffle, but at a good speed.  The
policeman started in pursuit, but gave it up as hopeless
before he had gone very far; he stopped, blew a
shrill call on his whistle, and returned to Carstairs
who had now got upon his feet, still bent double with
pain.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, sir?" he asked.  "Robbery with
violence, or what?"
</p>

<p>
"Brutal assault, or attempted murder, God knows
which," Carstairs groaned.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" the policeman said, producing a note-book.
"It's Mr Carstairs of the electric light, ain't it, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"That's it, and the other man is Sam Lee, gipsy who
was condemned for burglary about two years ago."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that's it, is it?  He was only let out a week
ago.  'As 'e got anything agen you, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Two other policemen were already in view.  Carstairs,
almost himself again, waited till they arrived,
and told all three the tale.  They listened with no
sign of surprise, (the English policeman is never
surprised), but they took profuse notes.
</p>

<p>
"We'll soon 'ave 'im," they said.
</p>

<p>
Next morning at the works, Carstairs sat in Darwen's
office, and told him the tale of his adventure.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it doesn't matter a curse if it all comes out
now, old chap, your position here is firmly established."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was thoughtful.  "My people won't like
if it gets into the papers.  I wonder what the girl
thinks about it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you may bet your boots she's used to that sort
of thing.  I'm going off to the meeting now.  Wish
you could come too, sure to be some fun.  However,
you'll see that engine tested?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I'll put 'em through their paces.  The
contractor's men are downstairs now."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, well, ta ta.  You'll be worth £50 more per
annum when I see you again."  Darwen laughed and
disappeared through the door.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs went down into the engine-room, and
looked all round the new engine and dynamo.
"Seems to me damn small for the power," he said
to himself.
</p>

<p>
Late that evening they met again in the office.
Darwen was beaming.  "You've got your fifty quid,
old chap, and I've got my hundred.  It was grand,
never had so much sport in all my life.  Donovan
opened the ball: I tell you I hardly recognized myself
under his glowing eulogies.  The Doctor objected.
Then Donovan went for him.  By Jove! old Donovan
<i>can</i> talk.  But the old Doctor was grand, he stood up
at the head of the table with his great chest heaving
and his beard seemed to quiver with anger.  'Retract,'
he roared, when old Donovan got personal,
I tell you he fairly frightened 'em.  If I hadn't been
there, he'd have crumpled 'em all up.  I'll swear they
each and every one of 'em shivered when the old man
glared at 'em.  Bull baiting's not in it.  Donovan
was about collapsed when I caught his eye and frowned
at him, then we went for the Doctor like a tiger.  The
others seemed to buck up then, till the old man roared.
'Get outside, sir, you're not fit to speak to a decent
assembly,' he said.  Then I put my spoke in, I swear
Donovan would have gone if I hadn't.  'Come!
Come!  Doctor,' I said.  'Hold your tongue, sir,'
he roared.  'You've no right to speak at all.'  That
old man thinks he's the schoolmaster of this town.
Then Jenkins gave him a hit below the belt.  'This
is Mr Darwen, not Mr Wakeley,' he said.  That's a
patient of the Doctor's, who died the other day with
something the matter with his tongue.  The old man
took no notice.  Then Evans gave him another dig,
and Smith had a rap at him.  Little Winter got up
to speak to him too, but when the old man wagged
his beard at him, his knees gave way, and he sat down
suddenly without saying a word; I never saw anything
funnier.  Then Sullivan got up and screamed
like a man with the devil behind him.  (I was the
devil, most pleasant sensation I've ever experienced).
Donovan capped it, and John Brown put a word in
for us, too.  I like that navvy, and I think the Doctor
does too, he very seldom bullies him, and gets as good
as he gives him.  They ought to put up a grand scrap,
those two, if they ever got going, just about a weight.
Anyhow it's passed alright, and there's no mistake
Donovan worked like a Trojan.  How did the test
pan out?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, it's off.  The damn thing wouldn't do much
more than three quarters of its load.  I knew it
wouldn't."
</p>

<p>
"Go on!  Is that right?"  Darwen's face expressed
incredulous surprise, there was a sort of smile there
too, with a strange little flicker of the eyelids whose
long lashes were drawn down till they almost
completely shaded the brilliant, beautiful eyes.
</p>

<p>
"That's quite correct."
</p>

<p>
"This is serious.  We must have another test
to-morrow.  I'll be in myself."
</p>

<p>
"Alright, but I know she can't do it.  She hasn't
got the dimensions, anywhere."
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed suddenly.  "You're such a
stickler.  We mustn't be too hard on them, you know,
Peace on earth, etc., you know.  And we've just had
a rise."
</p>

<p>
"That's alright, of course, but I imagine we want
what we pay for."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, of course," Darwen said, picking up
his hat.  "Good night."  He went off rather suddenly.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
</h3>

<p>
That evening Carstairs went to call on Mrs
Darwen to ascertain if the girl had got back
again.  She had.  He almost ran into her just outside
the house, she was going towards the town.
</p>

<p>
He turned and walked beside her.  "How's your
mother?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Better," she said coldly.  She kept very far away
from him.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry I had to run away and leave you the
other night."
</p>

<p>
"It didn't matter in the least.  I was rather glad."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs had a momentary impulse to turn on his
heel and leave her for good and all without any more
words, but he was by nature an inquirer, he liked to
get to the bottom of things, besides he was in love with
this girl and he felt there must be some vital
misunderstanding somewhere.
</p>

<p>
"I see," he said, "that sweep has been telling you
some of his cursed lies with his music lessons."
</p>

<p>
She stopped and faced him.  "Will you kindly tell
me which way you are going?  Because I'll go a
different way.  Or is it necessary to make a fuss?"
</p>

<p>
He stared at her in amazement for a moment, then
he stepped a little closer and looked into her eyes.
"I am going back to my diggings in Clere Road.  I
shall never come this way again.  I wish I could leave
this rotten town and these rotten people for ever.
But let me tell you that that man is a rogue, how great
a rogue only God knows.  And if you think he's going
to marry you, you're greatly mistaken.  He's deceived
two girls in this town, and the Lord only knows how
many more elsewhere.  He could paper his room with
girls' photographs and girls' letters."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," she said in icy politeness; she had
studied the manners of her superiors to some purpose,
but in her they did not seem a burlesque as is usually
the case with the superior servant.
</p>

<p>
He looked at her steadily for some moments in
silence, and she returned his gaze quite calmly.  "I
was in love with you," he said, "and I felt I had done
your friend Sam Lee an injustice.  Now I feel that I
have done him a kindness in saving him from a very
exceptional fool."
</p>

<p>
"I am honoured," she said.  "Your friend and
benefactor, Mr Darwen, has at least the manners of a
gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"I'll take your word for it.  I imagine you know,
the penny novelettes describe the article very
minutely."  He looked into her eyes and saw that
they blazed with anger; the sight reminded him of a
similar occasion in Scotland when she carried a big
stick and they stood facing each other at the door of
his diggings.  His anger faded at once.  "I'm sorry,
I've behaved like a cad, but the issues were so
important, to me.  An apology, I suppose, is all the
reparation I can offer."  He turned and walked away,
leaving her there.
</p>

<p>
She stood and watched him till he was out of sight,
but he never looked back.  He was not built that way.
On his way to the works next morning, Carstairs
heard the news-boys shouting, "mysterious murder
of Councillor Donovan."  He bought a paper and
read the account.
</p>

<p>
"At an early hour this morning Police Constable
Garret observed a body floating down the river near
the High Street Bridge.  On being dragged ashore,
it was at once recognized as that of Councillor Donovan,
proprietor of the Blue Anchor Hotel, Dock Street.  The
unfortunate gentleman's neck was dislocated, and his
ribs squashed in as though by some powerful animal."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs did not read any more, but hurried on
down to the works; he searched out Bounce in the
engine-room.
</p>

<p>
"You saw that man who was killed in the garden
at Chilcombe, didn't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that looks like the same thing, doesn't it?"
Carstairs handed him the paper.
</p>

<p>
Bounce read it with a serious face.  "Looks like
the same," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Look here," Carstairs looked at his watch.  "Come
on down to the mortuary with me, we'll have a look
at it, and you can tell the police what the other chap
was like."
</p>

<p>
So they went off together, and on the way Bounce
explained.  "When we was on the China station, we
called at Borneo once, some of our chaps went ashore
and went up country a bit.  They seen the niggers
come running out of the woods, shouting like hell,
so they goes in to see what the trouble was.  There
was a monkey there.  He wasn't so very big, an' one
of our chaps went in to capture him&mdash;well, when they
brought 'im back to the ship, 'e looked just like that
bloke I seen at Chilcombe."
</p>

<p>
A policeman let them into the mortuary, and as
Bounce gazed on the dead body of Councillor Donovan,
he shook his head in mystification.  "Just the same,"
he said.  "Exactly the same."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was very serious.  "This is damnable,"
he said.  "I must see Darwen."
</p>

<p>
The policeman took profuse notes from Bounce,
and then they returned to the works together.
Carstairs proceeded at once to Darwen's office.
</p>

<p>
He held out a paper.  "Have you seen that?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
Darwen read it thoughtfully and slowly, then he
whistled softly.  "Poor old Donovan," he said.  He
seemed lost in thought for a moment or so, then he
repeated, "Poor old Donovan.  And only yesterday
he got us our rises, Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
"What do you make of it?"  Carstairs was watching
him closely.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, murder, of course.  Singular resemblance to
that chap who was killed over at your place."
</p>

<p>
"That's what struck me."  He caught just a
quick glance from Darwen's dark, penetrating
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"There's no doubt, of course, between ourselves,
that Donovan got entangled in his own web, some of the
particularly sharp tools he employed have eventually
cut him."  He looked Carstairs steadily in the eyes
as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Ye&mdash;es, I suppose that's it.  This is a damn funny
place.  I don't like it a bit."
</p>

<p>
"You're right, old chap.  It is funny.  The world's
funny.  Old Donovan lived down among the docks
with sailors and foreigners; all sorts, Lascars,
Chinamen, and niggers frequented his pub; besides, he was
a bookmaker.  God only knows how he met his end.
Poor devil!"
</p>

<p>
"He's not much loss to civilization, that's a
certainty, but it seems to come rather near home,
somehow."
</p>

<p>
"Don't let that worry you, old chap.  How about
this test?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, the engine's running, but she won't do her
load.  That little fool from the contractors calmly
opened the emergency valve, letting high pressure
steam into the low pressure cylinder, when I wasn't
looking.  'How's that?' he said, triumphantly.  Of
course I knew what he'd done at once."
</p>

<p>
Darwen smiled.  "You must give 'em a bit, old
chap."  He leaned back in his office chair, and looked
up at Carstairs, who was standing.
</p>

<p>
"A bit.  By George!  If she passes on load, she
can't pass, by pounds, on the steam consumption.
However, you're the chief.  It's for you to pass it,
not me."
</p>

<p>
"You mistake, old chap."  Darwen's voice was
remarkably suave and silvery.  "That's part of your
job, to test all the engines."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, then I don't pass it.  I'll stop it at
once and tell them to start taking it down to return
to the makers."
</p>

<p>
"That won't do, old chap, we must have the engine,
can't get on without it much longer.  You know that
better than I do."
</p>

<p>
"Alright, then let us take it at three quarters its
specified power.
</p>

<p>
"That's absurd, old chap."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I have nothing further to suggest, unless
you test the engine and pass it yourself."
</p>

<p>
"No, I shan't do that.  Perhaps&mdash;er&mdash;perhaps
some other chief assistant would do it."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so."
</p>

<p>
Darwen stood up and going over to Carstairs placed
a hand affectionately on his shoulder.  "Look here,
Carstairs, we must have that engine.  I'm going to
have it, and you're going to pass it.  I'll come down
and have a look at it while he's got the by-pass open,
so that I shall be able to say that I saw it doing the
load alright, then you can give me the steam consumption
figures for the run.  See?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I see very clearly, but I'm not going to do it."
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap," Darwen beamed with the best of
good nature.  "Think what it means!  In your
position I'd have done it.  I've got past that now.
You're getting £250, or you will be next month, and
just waiting to step into my job when I leave, which
I can assure you won't be long.  Don't be an ass,
Carstairs.  I'm going to have that engine."
</p>

<p>
"That, of course, is for you to say."
</p>

<p>
A momentary gleam of anger like a flash of forked
lightning shot across Darwen's face, but he smiled
again banteringly.  "I can't understand how such
a clever chap as you can be such a fool.  You don't
seem able to grasp the fact that the cleverness one is
paid for in this world, is the cleverness to outwit other
people, not the ability to disentangle abstruse
problems in the higher mathematics.  Trot on down and
get me out the figures for the steam consumption like
a good chap."
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Darwen, I'm not going to do your
dirty work.  I'm sick and tired of you and your
roguery.  You're a liar, and a cheat and a thief.
God only knows if you aren't worse!"
</p>

<p>
"Dear boy!  The elite of mankind is composed of
such people.  As long as you don't call me a fool, you
won't offend me.  Are you going to pass that engine?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Alright.  Good-bye.  Call at the office for a
month's screw to-morrow morning."  He sat down
again in his chair and leaned over his table.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs laughed.  "You're calling me a fool," he
said, "but I'm not a bit offended.  I know it's the
reflection entirely of your own intellectual shortcoming.
What do you think Dr Jameson would say?  What
would the council? the whole blooming town say?
If I told them I'd got the sack because I refused to
pass an engine which wasn't up to specification.  I
imagine, Mr Darwen, you're prepared to reconsider
your decision, for a start, eh? just for a start."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, Carstairs, I'm proud of you, and it's all
my teaching, every bit.  'Ye ponderous Saxon
swingeth ye sledge hammer.'"  Darwen smiled like
the rising sun in June.  "God! what glorious weather
we're getting.  Look at the sky, Carstairs!  Did you
ever see a sky like that in October?"
</p>

<p>
"The sky's alright.  I should have thought the
the earth beneath your feet had more concern with
you."  He pointed downwards with his finger.  He
was feeling rather well pleased with himself.
</p>

<p>
"Well done, Carstairs.  The earth is good.  I adore
the earth, that is nature.  Earth, Ocean, Air, beloved
brotherhood.  It's a pity you don't ready poetry,
Carstairs."  He smiled, genially.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs remained silent, impassive.  He watched
him as he watched an engine when he tested it;
looking at everything, expecting anything.
</p>

<p>
"When I was taking my before-breakfast walk
this morning, I came across a slow-worm; rather late
for a slow-worm in October, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Couldn't say."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I thought you were an observer of these
things.  It's rather a pity.  Still, I'll proceed.  I
touched his tail with my stick, and&mdash;you know the
usual result&mdash;he promptly waggled it off and left it
on the footpath while the rest of him disappeared in
the long grass.  Now the slow-worm thought that
was smart, but it was really only silly.  I didn't want
his tail, or the rest of him; he thought I did, he was
used to people who did, he thought I was a common
or garden fool.  So do you, Carstairs.  You can go
right now to Dr Jameson or to the devil himself; in
fact, you can do what you damn well please.  I have
no further use for you, and that being the case, I don't
intend to carry you around on my back any longer."
</p>

<p>
"Very well."  Carstairs turned without another
word and opened the door.
</p>

<p>
"Stop a minute."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs turned.
</p>

<p>
"Shut the door half a minute.  Won't you sit down?"
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! the strange uncouth ways of the Saxon.
However, it doesn't matter.  You don't want to hit
a fellow when he's down, Carstairs?"
</p>

<p>
"No, but I want to knock him down."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! the incomprehensible Saxon.  You wouldn't
see a poor devil with an old mother and a wife and
family chucked out on the streets, or sent to quod?"
</p>

<p>
"What are you pulling my leg about now?  You
haven't got a wife and family."
</p>

<p>
"Me!  Oh dear, no.  I'm not down.  Ha! ha!
You can't touch me, old chap.  I haven't passed the
engine.  As a matter of fact I told the contractor's
man yesterday I was afraid she wouldn't do, and I
drafted a letter to the firm, telling them so.  It's
not sent yet; the clerks are awaiting my signature to
the typed copy."
</p>

<p>
"Then what have you been playing all this game about?"
</p>

<p>
"This is the game of life, dear boy, a sort of universal
high jinks.  Let me explain.  I'm going to have that
engine, and if you kick up a row, either before or after,
you won't touch me.  All that will happen will be
that half a dozen poor fools, who are at present earning
a precarious living as tools, tools of the inexpensive
order, will be chucked aside."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stepped to the door again.  "Alright,
we shall see."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be in such a beastly hurry.  Sit down."
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks."
</p>

<p>
"Alright.  In case of a rumpus, the first man to
go overboard would be Winter, poor little helpless
Winter.  He was rushed into the council because he
was a fool, he accepted a five-pound note because he
was a thundering fool, and his wife was ill and the kids
hadn't got togs, and because everybody else was having
five-pound notes.  He'd be the first sacrifice.  Poor
old Winter, he looks like a thief; really, he's got a
better (or worse) conscience than a nonconformist
minister; that five pounds has pulled him down
astonishingly, I've watched him wither away.  And
his kids, poor little mites!  All through nature one
observes that the small units increase at an astonishingly
high ratio.  He only got one five quid."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was silent as a carven image.
</p>

<p>
"You're damned hard, you know, Carstairs.  Then
there's the contractor's man there.  He'd get the
bullet, and two or three fitters also.  Possibly a clerk
or two and my chief assistant would go to quod, even
the honest and highly virtuous Mr Carstairs, son of the
vicar of Chilcombe, who would die, with his wife,
broken-hearted."
</p>

<p>
"That'll do, Darwen.  I'll go and see Dr Jameson
and a solicitor at once."
</p>

<p>
"Carstairs, the mater's taken a fancy to you, and
I'll admit you appeal to me more than any man I've
ever met.  So damned ponderous.  Your moment of
inertia must be simply enormous.  Isn't it possible
to save you in your own despite."  He touched an
electric bell.  An office boy appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Ask Mr Slick if he'll come up here a minute, will
you, please."  Darwen was invariably excessively
polite, even to the minutest and most sub-divided
portions of humanity.
</p>

<p>
"Slick and I will endeavour to show you, Carstairs,
that you've got 'no case,' as I believe they say in
law."
</p>

<p>
Mr Slick appeared.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Here you are!"  Darwen shook hands
cordially.  "Mr Carstairs is not satisfied with your
engine, Mr Slick.  Won't come up to specification,
he says."
</p>

<p>
Mr Slick raised his eyebrows; he was a hard-looking
citizen, with strong prominent jaw and piercing blue
eyes.  "I understood that he expressed himself as
quite pleased yesterday."
</p>

<p>
"That's absurd, Slick, you know very well&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Darwen held up his hand.  "Don't wrangle in my
office, please, gentlemen!  You have some support
for your statement, of course, Mr Slick?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course; my two erectors heard him say it."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I think I understand the Shift Engineer to
say he was present also.  The fact is I've written to
your firm expressing approval of the engine, on, as I
understand, Mr Carstairs' advice.  Now there seems
to be some hitch.  However, we will come down and
see to that presently, Mr Slick.  Thanks very much
for coming up."
</p>

<p>
The contractor's engineer looked inquiringly at
Darwin, then he disappeared through the door again.
</p>

<p>
Darwen turned to Carstairs.  "Do you comprehend
that you're bowled out, yet."
</p>

<p>
"No.  By Jove!  I don't."
</p>

<p>
Darwen's eyes were wide with admiration.  "Ye
gods!  Ye gods!" he said.  "Look here, Carstairs,
you and I must continue to be pals, I'll share with you.
When I came here, the councillors were sharing the
'profits,' and old Jones was getting an occasional five
quid.  Now, I get the profits and the councillors get
the occasional five quid.  See?  Will you go halves?
And I tell you halves is something pretty good, too!"
</p>

<p>
"No, I won't.  I'll have my market price as an
engineer&mdash;no more and no less.  I can do for one
dollar what any fool can do for two.  I want my share
of the dollar I save."
</p>

<p>
"You won't get it, old chap."
</p>

<p>
"But I will!  I'll tell you what I'll do.  If you chuck
this sharp practice and send those engines back, we'll
make this place pay well, and the council shall give
us our whack."
</p>

<p>
Darwen was thoughtful for a minute.  "They
won't do it," he said.  "The fool in the street, the
voter, whose mind runs in shillings per week, wouldn't
let them.  In municipal work it doesn't pay to be
honest."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stroked his chin in perplexity.  "You're
an enigma to me.  You seem such a sound sort of chap
in most things.  Damn it!  One doesn't expect a
Clifton man to be a blasted rogue.  Can't you run on
straight lines?  You know you're bound to get bowled
out sooner or later."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be such a pessimist, Carstairs.  I hate
pessimists.  Let me assure you, you are equally an
enigma to me.  I fail entirely to comprehend your
mind.  Why do you worry and dissipate your energies
deciding what is right and what is wrong?  What
you really want to know is, what is best.  There is
nothing wrong in this best of all worlds, only degrees
of rightness.  All effort that produces no tangible
personal benefit is so much wasted energy.  You're
not an Atlas, you can't carry the world on your
shoulders.  The whole scheme of nature was evolved
for the benefit of individuals, not classes, or masses, or
groups.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating: I'm
always happy, and the keenest source of my pleasure
is in out-witting my fellow-men.  Life is a perpetual
game of skill, and like the integral calculus there are no
rules.  You're a mathematician, you like mathematics.
I've seen you grubbing your snout into 'Salmon's
Conic Sections' just on top of a Sunday's dinner.
Why don't you step up with me into the higher planes
of really applied mathematics; applied as all such
things should be, to men and women?  We'd have a
rare time, you and I.  When we boxed the other day
we agreed at the start that we would slog; we
started out to bump each other for all we were worth;
we both got several severe punches; I got a split
lip and you got a black eye, but we enjoyed it,
didn't we?"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs sat down with a heavy plump into a chair.
"You ought to be put in an asylum, not in prison,"
he said, wearily.  "I wonder if I gave you a good
hammering if it would do any good."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit, old chap.  Besides, I rather doubt your
ability to do it."
</p>

<p>
"There's an element of uncertainty," Carstairs
admitted.
</p>

<p>
They regarded each other with measuring eyes.
Carstairs allowed his gaze to roam slowly over the
thick, clean neck, the well-developed, lissom-looking
shoulders, and last of all rested on the clean-cut,
patrician face with the small, neat moustache just
shading the well-moulded, full red lips, quite closed;
and the brilliant, clear eyes that sparkled with a bold,
clear intelligence.  They were two splendid animals,
these two young men, spotlessly clean, well groomed.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you what, Darwen.  I'll fight you now, to a
finish, whether you keep those engines or whether I
get the sack."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, old chap, that's a new form of the gamble
of our early youth&mdash;'heads, I win; tails, you lose.'  But
we shall come to a scrap all the same some day,
I know."
</p>

<p>
"That's so; I'm going away to open the campaign
now."  Carstairs picked up his hat.  "I'll call for
my screw, Monday.  By the way, I suppose it will be
at the increased rate?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm damned."
</p>

<p>
"It's all in the game, you know.  No need to lose
your temper over it."
</p>

<p>
"Good, jolly good.  I see I'm converting you.
By Jove, you shall have it."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
"I say!"
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!"
</p>

<p>
"Mind!  There are no rules.  No rules whatever."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks for the tip.  I see I'm converting you."
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, old chap.  I want a run for my money,
that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll do my best.  Ta-ta."  Carstairs disappeared.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
</h3>

<p>
Carstairs went straight from the works to
Dr Jameson's private house.  The Doctor
was seriously ill and could not be seen, so he went
back to his diggings in deep thought.  "Better
go home and see the guv'nor before I do anything
now.  Oh, the fearful and wonderful British law,"
he thought to himself.  He saw the landlady and
gave notice.
</p>

<p>
"Have you got another appointment, Mr Carstairs?"
she asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, I've got the sack," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" she said.  "Has Mr Darwen&mdash;" she
stopped; she wanted to know all about it, but did
not know how to ask.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Darwen has sacked me, yes," he said; Carstairs
was a most unsatisfactory subject for a woman
to tackle, he left so much to the imagination.  "I
shall leave about three o'clock on Monday afternoon,"
he explained, as a conclusion to the subject.  He
produced his drawing board and settled down to do
a good afternoon's work on his slowly evolving patent.
As he bent low over the board, scrutinizing some fine
detail work, his eye caught an extra pin-hole on the
edge of the clean white board.  He dug the point of
his pencil thoughtfully into it.  "That's funny,"
he said to himself.  "I don't remember to have done
that."  He looked around at the three other corners
and saw pin-holes in all of them.  It was a new board
and he had never had a sheet of paper on it of the size
indicated by the pin-holes.  "Some devil has been
taking a tracing of this, our esteemed friend, Darwen,
or his agents, no doubt."  He leaned back in his chair
in deep thought for a time, then he bent forward and
set to work vigorously again.
</p>

<p>
He was still busy when the landlady's daughter
brought in his tea.  He looked up casually and caught
her eye bent on his work with extreme interest.
"Good evening, Miss Hughes," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, Mr Carstairs," she answered, and
she had summoned up a defiant sort of air to meet
his eye.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs' face was like the Sphinx.  "I'm going up
to London to-morrow.  Would you mind letting me
have breakfast at half-past six?  I shall come back
by the eleven twenty, but I've got a very important
piece of work here I want to finish before I go, so
please don't let me be disturbed for the rest of the
evening."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, Mr Carstairs.  Half-past six, and I'll
see no one disturbs you."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks very much."  Carstairs regarding her
steadily with his calm, inquiring eyes, caught a gleam
in hers that she did not want to be seen; he gave no
sign, and she went away quite oblivious of the fact
that he had read her like an open book.
</p>

<p>
Next day he went off to London and saw his lawyer
brother; they talked over his case against Darwen,
and his brother very quickly decided that he had
"no case."  So Carstairs returned, and in the stillness
of the wee sma' hours he examined the drawing again,
and found, as he expected, four more pin-holes.  He did
not smile; when in company his mirth was seldom
excessive, when alone, his features never for one
second relaxed their attitude of calm seriousness.
He replaced the drawing board in its position, leaning
against the wall behind the piano, and went to bed.
</p>

<p>
The following Monday he called at the office for
his month's pay.  He waited at the little shutter that
the men were paid at, while the office boy went to
fetch a clerk who fetched another clerk, who consulted
with the first clerk, and called a third clerk and sent
the office boy for a book and a pen, then they all
three consulted together again and reprimanded the
office boy before handing the cheque through the little
shutter.  Which entire rigmarole was the outcome
of insufficient work, and too sufficient pomposity.
While Carstairs waited, Darwen opened the door of
his office.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, old chap, come inside.  Here, Morris,
bring that cheque along with you."  He held out his
hand.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs ignored it.  "Thanks, I won't stay, I'm
just going off to Chilcombe."
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed.  "A Saxon," he said, "is an
individual who proceeds along 'strait' lines.  I was
going to ask you to come home with me this evening.
The mater would like to see you."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks very much.  I should like to see your
mother, but I'm afraid I can't stop this evening."
</p>

<p>
The clerk brought out the cheque.  Darwen took
it and, glancing over it, handed it on to Carstairs.
"There you are, old chap.  I'm sorry it's the last."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs took it.  "Thanks," he said.  "Good-bye,"
and turning on his heel he went out for the last
time.
</p>

<p>
Darwen watched him through the window as he
walked down the street with his long swinging stride.
"The reason, personified, of why England owns half
the earth," he said, to himself.  "And equally the
reason that she doesn't own the whole of it," he added,
thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
He lay back in his chair and gazed far into the
future, mental pictures in many colours shaped
themselves in kaleidoscopic procession across the white
expanse of ceiling.  For half an hour he sat thus,
then sitting suddenly upright, and drawing in his
outstretched legs, he plunged back into the present
among the papers on his table.
</p>

<p>
Some six months later, in the dining-room at
Chilcombe Vicarage, there was held a family council
of war.  The old vicar was there, Commander Carstairs
was there, Phillip and Stanley Carstairs were there,
and they all looked serious.  For six months Jack
Carstairs had been applying for each and every one
of the multitudinous appointments advertized in the
technical papers, with no results; he had learned
through the same medium that Darwen had been
appointed to one of the London stations at £750 per
annum, to start; and that evening he had returned
from making personal application for a very junior
appointment at £1 per week in a neighbouring town.
The chief (of German antecedent), the personification
of ignorance and bombast, had catechized and bullied
him, cross-examined and contradicted him, and
finally abruptly refused him the billet.
</p>

<p>
Jack was speaking, and they all listened attentively.
"When a German ex-gasfitter, with a little elementary
arithmetic and less electrical catalogue information,
talks to me as though he were a miniature Kaiser
and I the last-joined recruit of his most unsatisfactory
regiment, and then refuses me a switchboard
attendant's job on technical grounds, then, I admit,
my thoughts lightly turn to robbery with violence
as a recreation and means of livelihood.  He'd have
liked me to say 'yes, sir,' and 'no, sir,' and 'please,
sir,' and touch my cap and grovel in the dirt.  I'd
see him in hell first."
</p>

<p>
"I always said, Hugh, you ought to have put that boy
in the Service," the sailor interjected, quite seriously.
</p>

<p>
The others smiled, a wry, sickly sort of smile.
</p>

<p>
"Can't we&mdash;er&mdash;don't we know somebody with some
influence on these councils who would use it on Jack's
behalf."  It was the artist who spoke.
</p>

<p>
The young engineer stood up suddenly with
unwonted passion.  "Damn it!  I'm not a blasted
mendicant!  I'm a competent engineer!  It's no use
talking rot about modesty.  I know what I have done
and can do again.  I say I'm a competent engineer.
I've been getting two hundred and fifty quid a year,
and earning it, saving it for the people who paid me.
And I am willing to take a quid, one blasted quid a
week, and I can't get it.  I'm not going to beg for
my own cursed rights.  In all those hundreds of jobs
I've applied for, I must have been the best man on
my paper form alone.  If I can't live as an engineer
in my own cursed country, then, by God!  I'll steal."  He
turned on his father with blazing eyes.  "I say, I'll
steal, and if any blundering idiot or flabby fool tries
to stop me, I'll kill him dead.  The first law of life
is to live.  What do you say to that?  You preach
platitudes from the pulpit every Sunday, what have
you to say to the logic of the engine room?"
</p>

<p>
The old vicar smiled, somewhat sorrowfully.
"I might say that you are possessed of a devil," he
said, with quiet humour.  "Your engineering
experience ought to tell you that it's no use ramming your
head against a brick wall."
</p>

<p>
Jack sat down.  "That's so," he said, "there's an
obstruction somewhere; the thing to do is to find it
out and remove it."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, Hugh! the initial mistake was in not
putting that boy into the Service; though there's a
maxim there that promotion comes 80 per cent. by
chance, 18 per cent. by influence, and 2 per cent. by
merit."
</p>

<p>
"That's rot, you know, unless you mean to say that
18 per cent. of the men in the Service are snivelling
cheats."
</p>

<p>
The sailor was thoughtful.  "There are some cheats
in the Navy, but not many; as a rule it's not the
man's own fault that he is promoted by influence.  At
the same time you can't afford to get to loo'ard of
your skipper, much depends on one man's word, but
that man is usually a&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Sportsman," Jack interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"Well! 'an officer and a gentleman' they call him.
The Service would have suited you."
</p>

<p>
"My dear uncle, I have all respect for the Service,
but at the same time I should not wish to be anything
but an engineer, and engineers in the Service at the
present time are somewhat small beer.  Anyway, as a
money-making concern, the Service don't pan out
anything great.  Bounce told me that the seamen
haven't had a rise in pay since Nelson's time."
</p>

<p>
The sailor laughed.  "That's a good old A.B.'s
growl," he said.  "I gather, too, that engineering is
not panning out so very great as a money-making
concern just now."
</p>

<p>
"No! you're right.  I'm a bit sick when I think of
it, too, it's rather sickening.  I've got a model upstairs
of an engine that would make any man's fortune, and
I can't get the fools to take it up.  I think I shall
have to break away for the States."
</p>

<p>
They were all silent for some minutes till the old
vicar rose.  "Shall we go to bed?" he said, and they
proceeded upstairs, solemnly, silently, in single file.
</p>

<p>
The weeks passed away and Jack's uncle went back
to sea, and his brothers returned to London, and
another brother came and went.  The winter changed
to spring, the days lengthened out and grew brighter,
and still Jack Carstairs could get nothing to do, nor
get any one to take up his patent.  Then one morning
amongst the two or three letters awaiting him was
one with a penny stamp: the ha'penny ones he knew
were the stereotyped replies of the various
municipalities to the effect that they "regretted" his
application had not been successful; it was a way they
had, they sent these things with a sort of grim humour
about a month after he had seen by the papers that
some one else had been appointed; it wasn't very
often they went to the extravagance of a penny stamp
for a refusal, so he opened that first, glancing casually
at the city arms emblazoned on the flap of the envelope;
enclosed was a typewritten letter, he was appointed
switchboard attendant at £1 per week.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs gazed at it sternly with bitter hatred of
all the world in his heart.  "A blasted quid," he said,
aloud.  "Ye gods! a quid a week!  And Darwen,
the cheat, is getting £750."  He hadn't fully realized
when he was writing his applications for these small
appointments, exactly the extent of his fall; but now,
as he had it in typewritten form before his eyes, and
signed, he looked again, signed by a man who had
served his time with him.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Carstairs was humbly thankful for small
mercies, but the old vicar, whom Jack found alone
in his study, looked into his son's eyes and read the
bitterness of soul there.  "Do you think it would be
wise to refuse and wait for something better.  This
is your home you know.  You can work on your
patent."
</p>

<p>
"I thought of all that before I applied," Jack
answered.  "The patent!  The path of the inventor
seems the most difficult and thorny path of all."
</p>

<p>
The old man's eyes brightened; he liked the stern
definiteness of his youngest son.  "It does seem hard,"
he said.  "I don't understand these things, but I
think you are wise to take this appointment."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!  I have no idea of refusing, but when I
think that that lying cheat, Darwen, is getting £750
a year, it makes me feel pretty sick."
</p>

<p>
"I know, Jack; we see these things in the Church the
same as everywhere else; the cheat seems sometimes
to prosper.  Why it should be so, I cannot comprehend;
the cheat must inevitably cheat himself as the liar
lies to himself, so that they both live in a sort of fool's
paradise; they both unaccountably get hold of the
wrong end of the stick; they imagine that they are
successful if they satisfy others that they have done
well, while the only really profitable results ensue when
one satisfies oneself that one has done well; then and
only then, can real intellectual, moral, and physical,
progress follow.  It is possible to imagine a being of
such a low order of morality that he could feel a real
intellectual pleasure in outwitting his fellow-men by
cheating; such an one, it seems to me, must be very near
the monkey stage of development.  As man progresses
intellectually he sets his intellect harder and harder
tasks to perform, else he declines.  It is possible that
the cheat may occasionally reap very material and
worldly advantages by his cheating.  Some few
apparently do, though the number must be extremely
small and the intellectual capacity exceedingly great,
for they are constantly pitted, not against one, but
against the whole intellect of the world, including
their brother cheats.  The rewards and the punishments
alike, in the great scheme of the Universe, are
spread out unto the third and the fourth generation;
the progeny of the cheat, in my experience, decline
in intellect and moral force till probably the lowest
depths of insanity and idiocy are reached.  This great
law of punishment for the sins of the fathers is beyond
my mental grasp, but that it is so I cannot doubt;
it is in fact, to me, the greatest proof that there must
be something beyond the grave.  You understand,
Jack, I'm not in the pulpit, this is worldly wisdom,
but I want to set these things before you as they
appear to me.  You must forget Darwen; you reap
no profit from his success or failure, but you expend
a large amount of valuable energy in brooding over
it.  'Play up, and play the game,' Jack.  Don't
cheat because others are cheating, if you do you are
bound to become less skilful in the real game.  Think
it over, Jack, 'Keep your eyes in the boat,' don't
think about the other crew or the prize, simply 'play
the game.'  Have you told your mother you're going?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Did you say you wanted to borrow some of my
books?"
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks.  I've got all the books I want.
You've seen my two packing cases full."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, yes!  I'd forgotten.  So you're going
to-morrow.  That's rather soon, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"I told them that if appointed I'd start at once.
I'm going to pack and then whip round and say
good-bye to my friends."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, of course.  I'll see you off in the morning;
six o'clock, did you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, six ten at the station."
</p>

<p>
So Jack took his hat and stick and strolled round
to his few friends in the village to tell them he was
going.  The Bevengtons were furthest away, and he
called there last.  Bessie had been away in London
and other places, nearly all the time he had been
home, when he called now she was home.  He had
heard she was coming.
</p>

<p>
"I've come to say good-bye, Mrs Bevengton.  I've
got a job, and I'm going up north again."
</p>

<p>
They both looked pleased; Mrs Bevengton really
liked Jack.  "When are you going?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow morning."
</p>

<p>
Bessie's jaw dropped, she was keenly disappointed,
and she looked, Jack thought, in the pink of condition,
more so than usual.
</p>

<p>
"I hope it's a good appointment, Jack," Mrs
Bevengton said; she was disappointed too.
</p>

<p>
"A quid a week," he answered, bluntly, looking at
her steadily.
</p>

<p>
Her jaw dropped also.  "Oh, but I suppose it will
lead on to better things."
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-five bob at the end of six months," he
said, with rather a cynical little smile.  Out of the
tail of his eye he regarded Bessie, she had flushed a
deep red at the mention of his microscopical salary.
She seemed more matured, her manner impressed him
with a sense of responsibility, an air of definiteness
that appealed to him immensely; he saw now that
her lips closed suddenly.  She had made up her mind
to something.
</p>

<p>
"Come on out for a walk, Jack," she said.  "I
haven't had a look round the old place for nearly a
year.  We shall be back to tea, mother."
</p>

<p>
She got her hat and they walked briskly down the
pleasant village street in the glorious spring sunshine;
every one they passed greeted them with civility and
respect.  Jack regarded them with pleasure; he told
Bessie they were the stiffest, hardest, and most
genuinely civil crowd he had ever encountered.
"Perhaps I'm biassed," he said, "but I like men and
these chaps appeal to me more than any others I've
met so far."
</p>

<p>
They turned across the fields and went more slowly.
"I've been having a good time, Jack, while I've
been away."
</p>

<p>
"So I expect," he answered.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've been to a lot of dances and parties and
theatres, etc.  I suppose I've enjoyed it&mdash;in a way."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I should think you would&mdash;in most ways."
</p>

<p>
"Jack!" she was walking very slowly.  "Two
men&mdash;three men, asked me to marry them."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I suppose they were not the right ones."  He
did not quite know what to say.
</p>

<p>
"Well, two of them were not&mdash;but one of them&mdash;it
was Mr Darwen."
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!"  Jack turned as though he had been
shot.  "Are you going to marry him?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't quite know.  I've come home to decide.  I
don't think I care for him in quite the right way.  Why
did he break off his engagement to Miss Jameson?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;"  Carstairs was thinking, thinking,
thinking.  He wondered what to do and what to say.
</p>

<p>
"He told me that he thought he was in love with
her till he saw me, then he knew he wasn't."
</p>

<p>
"Er&mdash;yes."
</p>

<p>
"He's very nice and very handsome, still I know
I don't care for him as&mdash;as I do for some one else."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was silent, he was trying to think.  The
situation was getting beyond him, he had a fleeting
idea of trying to change the subject, of closing the
matter; but he knew that once closed it could never
be re-opened, and he wanted to do the right thing.
They were silent for some minutes.
</p>

<p>
"Jack?" she asked, and the struggle was painful.
"Has my money made any difference to you?"
</p>

<p>
"Half a minute!" he said, hastily.  "Don't say
any more, please.  Let me think"&mdash;he paused&mdash;"Five
years ago I met a girl in Scotland."
</p>

<p>
"And you love her, Jack?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I thought not at one time, but I know now
that I do."
</p>

<p>
They walked for a long time in silence, then she spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I'll write to Mr Darwen to-night and tell him that
if he likes to wait a long, long time, I'll marry him,"
she said.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was silent; the great big English heart of
him was torn asunder.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you speak, Jack?  Mr Darwen's your
friend, isn't he?  He's handsome and so kind and
attentive, and if he cares for me as&mdash;as he says he
does, I think I ought to marry him.  I couldn't
before, but now&mdash;don't you think I ought?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, er&mdash;it's more a question for the guv'nor.
Will you let me explain the situation to him, and then
he'll see you.  The guv'nor's very wise, in these
things, and it's his province, you know.  I should like
you to talk to him."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks&mdash;thanks.  I will."
</p>

<p>
That night Jack Carstairs sat up very late with his
father in his study.  And next morning the train
whisked him north, to the dim, grey north, and the
engines, and the steam, and the hard, hard men,
mostly engineers.  Jack was very sad and silent in
his corner of a third-class carriage all the way.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
</h3>

<p>
For three months Carstairs worked steadily at
the beginning of things electrical; he cleaned
the switchboard and regulated the volts; he took
orders from a youth, rather younger and considerably
less experienced than himself.  For those three months
the world seemed a very dull place to him.
</p>

<p>
Then, quite by accident, as these things always
happen, he met a man, a casual caller, who wished to
see round the works; the shift engineer told Carstairs
off to show him round, because it was "too much fag"
to do it himself.
</p>

<p>
He was an oldish man with whiskers and heavy,
bushy eyebrows, just turning grey; his questions
were few and to the point, and Carstairs seemed to
feel he had met a kindred spirit at once.  He listened
attentively to Carstairs' clear and concise explanations,
and when it was over he did not offer him a shilling
as sometimes happened, but in the casual, unemotional,
north-country way, he handed him his card and asked
if he would like to see round his works "over yonder."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs glanced from the card in his hand to the
rather shabby individual, with the "dickey," and
slovenly, dirty tie, in front of him.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, I'll come to-morrow," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Will ye?  Then ye'll find me there at nine."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be there at nine, too."
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll see ye."  He held out his hand and gave
Carstairs a vigorous grip.  The name on the card was
the name of a partner of a very prominent firm of
engine builders.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs felt a singular sense of satisfaction for the
rest of the evening; his perturbed mind seemed at
peace, somehow.
</p>

<p>
Next morning, punctually at nine, he called at the
office and was shown round the extensive works by
the old man in person.  He explained and Carstairs
listened and made occasional comments or asked
questions.  And ever and anon he felt a pair of keen
eyes regarding him in thoughtful, shrewd glances.
When they had finished the circuit of the works,
Carstairs broached the subject of his patent, he felt
an extreme friendliness towards this rough, shrewd
man, and he knew that his labours on the patent were
at last going to bear fruit.
</p>

<p>
The old man listened.  "You have a model?"
he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"I'll come round and see it."  And so he did there
and then.
</p>

<p>
In the dingy little back room of Carstairs' diggings,
he examined critically and minutely the small model.
</p>

<p>
"Ye made this yerself?"
</p>

<p>
"I did."
</p>

<p>
"Ay!"  It was a grunt of distinct approval.
</p>

<p>
They took it to pieces and spread the parts out on
the table, the old man examining them one by one.
He offered no comment, and Carstairs put it together
again and turned it with his hand, showing the beautiful
smooth running of it.
</p>

<p>
"Yon's well made!  Are ye a fitter?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!"
</p>

<p>
"Are ye not?  I was.  Will ye bring it round to
the office?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly."  Carstairs dismantled it and wrapped
the various parts up in paper.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take those," the old man said, and seizing two
of the heavier parts, he tucked them under his arm.
And thus, carrying it between them, they returned
to the big works.  There a long consultation was
held.  The junior partner (an ex-officer of the Royal
Engineers) was called in, and the final result was that
the firm undertook to manufacture the engine and pay
royalties to Carstairs.
</p>

<p>
"I must see a lawyer and get advice as to the terms
of the agreement," Carstairs said.  "I'm only free
in the mornings this week.  Will that suit you?"
</p>

<p>
"What are ye getting yonder?" the old man asked,
bluntly.
</p>

<p>
"A pound a week?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, ye can start here in the drawing office on
Monday at £2.  Will that do ye?"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, I'll give notice to-day."
</p>

<p>
The next six months passed like six days to
Carstairs; he hadn't time to write to any of his friends
and only an occasional scribble to his mother.  At the
end of that time the first engine built on his model
was finished and had completed a most satisfactory
run.  Then he took a holiday, and went home.
</p>

<p>
He had entirely lost track of all his friends and
station acquaintances.
</p>

<p>
"Bessie is not engaged," his father told him, "but
Darwen still pesters her with his attentions."
</p>

<p>
Jack was thoughtful.  "She's a jolly decent girl,
Bessie!  If Darwen were only honest!  I shall go up
to London, I want to see his mother."  So next day
Carstairs went off.
</p>

<p>
He called at Darwen's office.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, old chap!  How's the Carstairs' patent
high-speed engine going?  Eh?"
</p>

<p>
It was the same old, handsome, healthy Darwen;
bright-eyed, pink-cheeked, lively.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, alright.  Is your mother in London?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm blowed!"  There was that little flicker
of the eyelids that Carstairs knew so well.  "Yes,
there you are," he handed him a card with an address
on it.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks!  When will you be out?"
</p>

<p>
"Ye gods.  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  Good old Carstairs.
The northern air is simply wonderful for the nerves.
Ha!  Ha!  Ha!  I tell you what.  I'll go out this
evening, just to oblige you.  I'll go to the theatre.
I haven't seen the new thing at Daly's yet."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks!"  Carstairs turned and went away.  He
made his way to the address in South Kensington
that Darwen had given him.  It was a boarding-house;
he asked for Mrs Darwen and sent in his card.  The
German page-waiter sort of chap showed him up to
their private sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
She entered almost immediately, looking older and
whiter, her eyes more bleared and her cheeks deeply
furrowed.  She looked him sadly in the face.
</p>

<p>
"I knew you'd quarrel," she said.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," he answered.  "It couldn't be helped;
we didn't really quarrel, I called on him to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  There was a gleam of pleasure in her eyes.
"Why didn't you call on me before you left Southville?"
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't&mdash;then, he'd just broken me&mdash;chucked
me aside like a broken chisel.  I sent you my best
respects."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, so he said: I wondered if he lied.
You're&mdash;so&mdash;I thought you would have called&mdash;about the
girl."
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't, I was broke, that was why."
</p>

<p>
"You don't usually shirk."
</p>

<p>
"No, I try not to.  It didn't occur to me in that
light."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  She gave a deep sigh.  "You're the best
man, I think, I've ever met.  You want to know
where she is?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Then you have a good appointment?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, a firm is manufacturing my engine.  We
think it's bound to go."
</p>

<p>
"Charlie's got an engine, too."  She was watching
him very closely.
</p>

<p>
"Has he?"  Carstairs was rather interested.
</p>

<p>
"The drawings are in his room.  I'll go and get
them."
</p>

<p>
He put out a hand to stop her.  "I don't expect
he'd like me to see them," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! but I want you to.  I can trust you."
</p>

<p>
"You think I mightn't be tempted to get revenge
by cribbing his ideas?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I know you.  Besides yours is finished."
</p>

<p>
He was very serious.  "That's so, but I'm full of
ideas for improvements and other things, and it is
most difficult, when one sees a thing that is appropriate,
not to assimilate it consciously or unconsciously
into one's own ideas."
</p>

<p>
"Still, I'll get them," she answered.  She went out
and came back in a minute or two with a drawing
board and a roll of tracings.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs glanced over the drawing, and allowed just
a slight smile to pucker up the corners of his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  I knew," she said, "that's your engine."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!" he answered.  "It's not my engine."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him and saw he was speaking the truth.
She spread out the tracing.  "That girl from your
lodgings in Southville brought that round one day
when he was out; he never gets angry, but I know
he was annoyed because she'd left it."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs bent down and examined it.  "It's done
rather well," he said; "girls are good tracers.  I left
that for her to copy."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I didn't think you&mdash;I didn't know you knew.
I wanted to warn you."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks very much, but it wasn't necessary."
</p>

<p>
She heaved a very deep sigh of relief.  "That's been
on my mind like a ton weight.  I was afraid my boy
was a thief.  Very often I was on the point of writing
to you, but&mdash;you hadn't called."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was bent low over the drawing examining
some fine work very closely, he was so deeply
interested he did not look up as she spoke.  "That's
excellent work!  Darwen was always an artist, in
everything," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered, proudly, "he's very clever.
I'm so sorry you quarrelled.  I knew that girl would
come between you."
</p>

<p>
He looked up, impassive as usual.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she repeated, "but you're the one she really
likes, I know."  Mrs Darwen seemed to have grown
visibly younger.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs straightened himself and stood looking
down at her with his calm steady grey eyes.  "Ye-es,"
he said, he was thinking rapidly.  "Yes, I hope
that's true.  Will you give me her address; has
she&mdash;er&mdash;got a situation?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no! she's been in London, having her voice
trained.  She's got a magnificent voice."
</p>

<p>
"Where did she get the money from?" he asked,
he was quite pale, and his grey eyes glittered like
newly fractured steel.
</p>

<p>
She looked at him aghast, frightened; she put an
imploring hand on his arm.  "The girl's honest.  I
know she is.  I'm sure of it; she was saving.  I know
she was saving.  Perhaps Lady Cleeve&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps Charlie&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, no!  I know she wouldn't take anything from
him, because&mdash;because that was why she left."
</p>

<p>
Carstair's face lightened.  "Will you give me her
address?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"She's gone down to her people again, she came to
me yesterday.  They're encamped down at the old
place near Southville; it suits her father down there,
he's getting old and Scotland was too cold for him."
</p>

<p>
The words brought back a luminous vision to Carstairs;
his eyes took on a far-away look.  "My word! she
was full of pluck," he said, aloud, but really to
himself.
</p>

<p>
Mrs Darwen smiled with great pleasure.  "If&mdash;when
you've married her, you'll be friends with Charlie
again&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
He came to earth suddenly and considered.  "We
shall be friends," he said, "from now onwards, but
I'm afraid we can never again be chums.  I'll call and
see him before I go to the station."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," she said.  "Thank you, I'm so glad."
</p>

<p>
He shook hands and left her, and half an hour later
he called at her son's office.  The office boy showed him
in and he held out his hand.  Darwen grasped it with
a warm friendly smile.
</p>

<p>
"In the presence of other people," Carstairs said,
as the door closed behind the office boy, "we are
friends, because your mother is one of the best women
on this earth.  How she came to have such a whelp
as you, Lord only knows.  Do you agree?"
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap, I am honoured and delighted.  It
is not often one gets an opportunity of shaking an
honest man by the hand, even though the excuse for
doing so is a lie."  He smiled his most charming smile.
"You're putting on weight, Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, but I'm in the pink of condition."
</p>

<p>
"So am I."
</p>

<p>
"That's good.  Your mother isn't looking so well."
</p>

<p>
"No, I've noticed it myself."  A shade of real anxiety
passed across Darwen's face.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs noted it, and his opinion of Darwen went
up; he stepped up close.  "Look here," he said,
"she was worried because she thought her son was a
damned rogue.  I've told her&mdash;at least given her to
understand, that he is not, and you'll find her looking
a different woman.  Do you see?"  He turned and
went out.
</p>

<p>
Darwen sat back in his chair lost in thought.  "That
man always makes me think.  Wonderful man, wonderful
man.  Damn him!"  He sat up suddenly and went
on with his work.
</p>

<p>
That night Carstairs reached Southville; he got out
and put up at a hotel for the night.  Before going to
bed he went out and strolled round the town in the
silence of the late evening.  Old memories crowded
back on him, and although they were not always
of pleasant happenings, the taste of them was sweet;
he had progressed since then, and he felt, in the bones
of him, he knew, that he was going forward.  His steps
turned mechanically towards the electric lighting
works, and before he quite realized where he was
going, he found himself facing the old familiar big
gates with the little wicket at the side.  He looked
at his watch.  "Eleven o'clock!  Wonder who's on."  He
paused a minute, then opened the wicket and went
in.  "Probably some of the men who knew me are
still here," he thought.
</p>

<p>
The engine room was just the same.  The hum of the
alternators and the steady beat of the engines thrilled
his blood.  He stood in the doorway for some minutes
in silence.  The sight of running machinery was meat
and drink to him.  A little square-shouldered man
wandered up to ask him what he wanted.  Carstairs
held out his hand.  "Hullo, Bounce, have you
forgotten me?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I never.  Mister Carstairs!  I ain't
forgotten you, sir, but you was in the dark."
</p>

<p>
"Any one I know left on the staff?  Who's in
charge?"
</p>

<p>
"A new engineer, sir.  They be all new since your
time."
</p>

<p>
"All new!  Ye gods, how fellows do shift about."
</p>

<p>
"They do, sir.  I've seen hundreds come and go
since I've been here."
</p>

<p>
So they stood talking for some time.  "I suppose
you're off at twelve, Bounce?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"It's nearly that now.  I'll wait.  You can come
round to my hotel and get a drink."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir.  I'll go and wash and change.
Would you like to see the engineer?"
</p>

<p>
"No, thanks, I'll just sit on this box and watch the
wheels going round: same old box, same old wheels.
How many hours of the night have I spent sitting on
this box listening to your damn lies, Bounce?"
</p>

<p>
"God only knows, sir."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs sat and waited, and all sorts of fresh
fancies and ideas thronged through his brain as the
wheels went round and the alternators hummed and
the corliss gear clicked.  A distinct and complete
idea for a valuable improvement shaped itself in his
mind as he watched and listened.  He stood up and
stretched himself with a sigh of great content.  "By
Jove, if old Wagner composed music like that, he'd
have done a damn sight more for humanity," he said
to himself, with a smile at the sacrilege of the thought.
To Carstairs, Wagner was a drawing-room conjurer,
not to be thought of at the same instant as men who
designed engines.  Bounce came down the engine-room
towards him with his wide-legged sailor's roll.
He was attired in a blue-serge suit, spotlessly clean
and neat.  His strong, clean-cut features and steady,
piercing eyes showed to great advantage in the
artificial light and against the dark background of his
clothes.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, Bounce, I can't understand why it is
you're not Prime Minister of England."
</p>

<p>
The little man's bright eyes twinkled, but his
features never relaxed.  "I can't understand it
myself," he said.
</p>

<p>
They went off together to the hotel, where Carstairs
drank whisky and Bounce rum.  The waiter looked
at him somewhat superciliously, till he met Bounce's
eye fair and square, then he seemed impressed.
</p>

<p>
"Dr Jameson is dead.  Mr Jenkins is chairman of
the committee now."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know."
</p>

<p>
They were silent for some minutes.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know this county well, Bounce?"
</p>

<p>
"Pretty well, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;do you remember my telling you about a
gipsy girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I want to find her; she's round here somewhere,
near the new water-works."
</p>

<p>
"I know, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Good man.  Can you drive&mdash;a horse I mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stood up.  "Now, look here, Bounce, I
really cannot understand&mdash;what the devil is there
you can't do?"
</p>

<p>
"I dunno, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Can you drive a perambulator?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;an' nurse the baby."
</p>

<p>
"Go on.  Tot up what you can do.  Honest.  No
lies, mind."
</p>

<p>
"Alright.  Here goes.  I can walk and run and
swim; box and wrestle and fence; shoot a revolver,
rifle, or big gun; push a perambulator, hand cart, or
wheel barrow; drive a steam engine, horse, or a
motor car; stroke a boiler, feed a baby, the missus,
an' the kids; scrub a floor, table, or furniture; make
and mend and wash my own clothes; light a fire, make
tea, coffee, or cocoa; make the beds and clean the
rooms; wash up dishes, lay the table and wait at
same; clean the windows, paint a house, and walk
along the roof."  Here he started to digress.  "I
remember once in Hong Kong&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That'll do, I've heard all about Hong Kong.
Let's hear about Bounce."
</p>

<p>
"There ain't much more that I can do," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense! you sing."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!  Sing a song, play the mouth organ.  Catch
fish (when they bite), dance the waltz, polka, hornpipe,
quadrilles, lancers, and schottische."  He paused.
</p>

<p>
"Go on."
</p>

<p>
"There ain't no more.  Oh, yes! read an' write
an' do sums."  He scratched his head.  "Sometimes,"
he added.
</p>

<p>
"I said no lies."
</p>

<p>
"Alright, cross out sums."
</p>

<p>
"What about ropes?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!  I can splice, reave, whip, knot, bend,
an' gen'rally handle ropes."
</p>

<p>
"Can you shave yourself and cut your own hair?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes an' no, but mind, I have 'ad a try at that.
I come aboard drunk once in&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Shut up.  What else can you do?"
</p>

<p>
"Drink a bottle of rum, brandy, whisky, gin, port,
sherry, champagne, beer, or any alcoholic liquors, with
anybody; and spin a yarn with the best."
</p>

<p>
"Very good.  I give you a first-class character.
Will you come out for a drive with me in the morning
and look after the horse while I&mdash;while I'm engaged?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, I will.  I knows all about it.  I courted
my missus between the spells of three-year cruises."
</p>

<p>
"Alright.  Half-past eight, here."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs tossed him his tobacco pouch.  "You
can take all that's in that."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir.  I forgot as to mention as I could
smoke and chew any baccy on the market.  This
yer&mdash;this yer," he reflected, thoughtfully, as he emptied
the pouch, "is what we calls boys' terbaccer."
</p>

<p>
"Go on home, Bounce."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."  He doubled up with violent mirth.
</p>

<p>
"You should have added that you could laugh like
a baby elephant."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."  He doubled up again, then, suddenly
straightening himself, saluted in all solemnity.
"To-morrow morning at half-past eight, sir."  He turned
and made his way out.
</p>

<p>
Next morning punctually at half-past eight Carstairs
and Bounce set off in a hired dog-cart for the gipsy
camp.  They drove along the beautiful country side
chatting lightly till they came (over the top of a hill)
into sudden view of a torn and trampled valley,
teeming with men; little locomotives steamed fussily
in all directions; gantry cranes wheeled and pivoted
and travelled with large blocks of stone from one
place to another.
</p>

<p>
"That's the new water-works," Bounce said.
</p>

<p>
"Alright, let's go down, some of the men will be
sure to know where the camp is."  They drove down
to the deeply rutted, slushy, entrance, a five-barred
gate was kept permanently open by the furrows of
rick brown earth turned up by the heavy cart wheels.
A strongly built, healthy looking individual dressed
in a tweed suit and yellow leggings and a cloth cap,
was picking his way carefully through the deep mud
of the gateway: he was the resident engineer.
Carstairs pulled up and shouted to him across the hedge,
"I say, is there a gipsy camp near here?"
</p>

<p>
The young man carefully balanced himself on a flat
stone in the middle of the sea of mud, then he looked
up and pointed with his hand.  "Yes, over there!
Go down to the bottom of the hill and turn to your
left, there's a bit of a common there.  Light green
common, they call it."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks!"  Carstairs whipped up and drove away.
"Healthy chaps those 'civils' always are," he
remarked.
</p>

<p>
"'Civils'?" Bounce asked.
</p>

<p>
"Civil Engineers."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!"
</p>

<p>
They drove in silence till they reached the bottom
of the hill and turned to the right.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, there it is.  Fancy that girl walking out here
by night."
</p>

<p>
"That's one thing I don't like&mdash;walking," Bounce
answered.
</p>

<p>
"No?  Here!  Catch hold! while I get out and
go over there."
</p>

<p>
The common was a triangular piece of land between
the forks of two roads; in one place it was fairly flat
most of the rest of it was composed of miniature hills
and dales, with steep sloping sides and flat bottoms,
inclined in places to be marshy.  It was on the flat
portion, under the shelter of one of these miniature
hills, that the caravans were drawn up in a scattered
group.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs walked up to the one he recognised, with
the little brass handled stairway, the bright paint and
fancy leather work; a little crowd of ragged urchins
and mongrel curs trailed after him.  He mounted the
steps and rapped at the little door.  It was promptly
opened and a woman looked out; although she was
much more haggard and worn looking he recognised
her at once, and he saw that she recognised him.
</p>

<p>
"She's not here, she's gone into the town to buy
things for father."
</p>

<p>
"Which town?  Not Southville?"
</p>

<p>
"No,&mdash;&mdash;."  She mentioned a little country town
about four miles away.  "She'll be back this evening."
</p>

<p>
He stood on the step and stroked his chin in thought.
"I've driven over from Southville, but my man can go
back with the horse.  Where do you think I could get
lodgings near here?"
</p>

<p>
"There's a public house in the village."
</p>

<p>
"Where's that?"
</p>

<p>
"Back along the road you came, only turn to the left."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks.  I'll call again to-morrow.  You're sure
she'll be here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, father's ill."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to hear that.  What's the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"He's dying."
</p>

<p>
"Dying!  Don't say that."
</p>

<p>
The woman shook her head.  "Would you like to
see him, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Er&mdash;"  Carstairs stood still a moment.
"Yes, I should.  Can I talk to him?  Something
important?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes.  He knows he's going, and it would do
him good to hear what you've got to say."
</p>

<p>
He stared at her in quick surprise for a moment,
and then stepped after her into the caravan.  It
was scrupulously clean and expensively upholstered;
the sides were partitioned off horizontally into little
bunks with neat brass rods and curtains to shut them
in; there were windows along the front and back and
sides with snowy white lace curtains to them; it was
not at all dingy, but very light and bright.  The
woman drew aside a curtain and showed the silver-haired
old man supported in a half-sitting position in
the bunk.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs could see at once that he was very weak,
and also that he was very well attended to.
</p>

<p>
The old man looked him steadily in the eyes.  "I've
seen you before.  How are you?" he said.  The voice
was very low.
</p>

<p>
"I'm first class, thank you.  I'm sorry to see you're
not so well."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I'm dying.  We've all got to die some time.
You want to marry my daughter?"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-258"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-258.jpg" alt="&quot;YES, I'M DYING&quot;">
<br>
&quot;YES, I'M DYING&quot;
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Carstairs answered, in some surprise,
nevertheless.
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  She told me," the old man nodded feebly
towards the gipsy woman.  "She knows everything."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was silent.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" the old man asked, after a pause,
during which he had closed his eyes and remained
quite still.
</p>

<p>
"My name is Carstairs&mdash;Jack Carstairs.  I'm the
son of the Reverend Hugh Carstairs, Vicar of
Chilcombe in Gloucestershire."
</p>

<p>
There was a short silence, then the old man spoke
again.  "Who was your grandfather?"
</p>

<p>
"He was a captain in the navy."  Carstairs was
rather surprised.
</p>

<p>
"That's alright.  I suppose we can't expect anything
better.  Get those papers!"  His last remark
was addressed to the woman.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stood silently wondering&mdash;mystified.  He
heard the woman unlocking something at the back
of the caravan, then she came up and held out some
parchment-looking papers.  The old man took them
in a feeble thin hand and laid them on the bed clothes
in front of him.
</p>

<p>
"I am Sir Thomas D'Arcy," he said.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was astonished beyond measure, but his
countenance showed very little of it.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," the old man continued, slowly, "I am Sir
Thomas D'Arcy, one time plain Thomas D'Arcy,
Professor of Music at Oxford, profligate and drunkard.
This gipsy woman is my legally married wife, and that
girl is my daughter; there is no estate, and the money
is all spent.  You can marry the girl when you are
getting £400 a year."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm damned."  Carstairs thought it so
fervently that for a moment he feared it must be
visible on his face, but the old man was resting with
closed eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Are you satisfied?" he asked, at length.
</p>

<p>
"Quite," Carstairs answered.
</p>

<p>
"What are you getting now?"
</p>

<p>
"£150 a year."
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;that's not much."
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;but I expect in the next six months to receive
royalties on patents to the extent at least of the other
£250."
</p>

<p>
"Very good&mdash;expectations do not always materialize.
However, those are the conditions.  You can go now."
</p>

<p>
He was moving away when the old man held up a
feeble, detaining hand.  Carstairs stayed in silence.
</p>

<p>
"There are other D'Arcys, but no relation to us.
I am the last.  We were really French, a French
noble family&mdash;with a strain of Italian running in us
too&mdash;&mdash;"  He rested again.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs pondered deeply while the old man paused.
Something of the outlines of the features in their
deathly pallor seemed familiar to him.  He gazed
hard at the face as it lay with closed eyes on the
pillows, then he asked, speaking slowly.  "Do you
know a Mrs Darwen?"  The resemblance he had
traced to the portrait in Mrs Darwen's album.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Darwen!"
</p>

<p>
"No; Mrs Darwen, she has one son."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly.  My son.  She's Miss Darwen.  Do you
know him?"
</p>

<p>
"I've met him."  Carstairs' face was like a carven
stone.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  She was the daughter of a yeoman farmer
in Oxfordshire, rather well to do, but of course I
couldn't marry her&mdash;then; the boy&mdash;is he any good?"
</p>

<p>
"He's very clever."
</p>

<p>
"He would be that, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Your daughter knows him."
</p>

<p>
"Does she?  I don't know who she knows.  You
must marry her.  She mustn't&mdash;mustn't know."
</p>

<p>
The old man sank back on his pillows and closed his
eyes.  Carstairs watched him for a minute or so, then
turned and looked interrogatively at the woman.
"Asleep?" he asked, quietly.
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  "Resting," she answered, and Carstairs
made his way very quietly out of the caravan.
</p>

<p>
"I'll come again to-morrow," he said.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
</h3>

<p>
Lost in thought, Carstairs made his way back
to the dogcart and Bounce.  He climbed in.
"Let's go to the village, Bounce, over there."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."  Bounce was all attention to business;
he asked no questions, and looked no questions, but
his mind was active in a very great wonder.
</p>

<p>
They drove in absolute silence till the village was
reached, then Carstairs spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I'm staying here the night.  Will you take the
horse back and come over again in the morning?"  He
took out his purse and handed Bounce some
money.  "I haven't seen the girl, I shall see her
to-morrow.  I've seen her father and her mother.  Her
father is dying."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to hear that, sir."
</p>

<p>
"So am I.  Good-bye."  Carstairs went into the
village inn, arranged for a room, got something to eat,
and set off to walk to the little town where the girl
had gone.
</p>

<p>
It was a beautiful day and the country was lovely,
but Carstairs had no spare thoughts to give to it;
he strode on and at a fast pace, observing nothing, till
long before he had disentangled the complicated skein
of his thoughts he found himself in the little town.
</p>

<p>
"What the devil am I to do now?" he asked himself.
"I'll walk right through the bally show till I
come out on the other side, then I'll turn round and
come back a different way," So he walked on again
and spent the whole afternoon to no purpose except
as far as exercise was concerned.  It was quite late
when he returned to the inn.  He got something to
eat and then sat in the little private bar smoking and
sipping a whisky and soda.  Through the thin partition,
from the tap room, he heard a huge uproar of
gruff voices.  It was pay night, and a great
concourse of navvies from the water-works were taking
their evening beer.  Carstairs caught scraps of
conversation, and occasionally references to a "toff"
who had been "standing" them beer.
</p>

<p>
He got up and wandered along the country lanes
in the dark, then he turned in and went to bed.
</p>

<p>
Early in the morning, just after he had finished
breakfast, Bounce arrived with the dogcart.
Carstairs saw him, through the little lattice window,
walking the horse up and down the village street.
He went out to him.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Bounce.  You're early."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs got into the cart.  "Drive over to the
camp," he said.
</p>

<p>
So they drove away, Bounce enlivening the journey
with little anecdotes of his travels.
</p>

<p>
"I picked up a 'bob' yesterday, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You're lucky."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, awful lucky chap I am; always picking up
something.  Picked up a barrel of beer once, me and
a mate."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a hogshead, I suppose; been lying on the
pavement for hours and nobody happened to notice
it till you came along."
</p>

<p>
Bounce laughed.  "Well, there was some other
blokes as reckoned they saw it first, but we didn't
take no notice of them, furriners, they was, see?"
</p>

<p>
"I see, didn't you give them a drink?"
</p>

<p>
"We offered to share out, but they wasn't satisfied
with that, so we took the lot.  Mind, there was a row
about it afterwards."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose there would be."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  'Asty blokes, them furriners.  We 'ad to
flatten 'em all out before we 'ad any peace.  Stiff
blokes they was too, some on 'em, but very soft about
the ribs, like punching a bladder of lard it was, sort
of unsatisfactory like."
</p>

<p>
"Ah."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  An' another time we picked up an old toff
with a bullet in 'im, that was in Rio.  Fine harbour,
Rio.  Give us ten dollars each 'e did, three on us."
</p>

<p>
"How did he get the bullet in him, Bounce?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, 'aving a bit of a spree, I s'pose, 'e never told
us.  'Nother time I picked up a bloke's 'and, cut off
at the wrist.  In Port Said, that were."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing in it, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"No, there wasn't, worse luck.  It weren't an
English 'and, you could see that."
</p>

<p>
By this time they had reached the camp, and Bounce
stopped the recital of his "lucky" incidents.
Carstairs got down.  "If I'm long, you can drive by
yourself to Southville.  I don't want to make you late."
</p>

<p>
"That's alright, sir.  I changed-over with my mate
to-day.  I don't go on till midnight."
</p>

<p>
"That's very kind of you, Bounce."
</p>

<p>
"Don't mention it, sir."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs went across to the caravan.  The gipsy
woman saw him coming and opened the door to greet
him.  "She came back and went away again first
thing this morning.  She'll be back this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs frowned and stared at the woman very
severely.  He thought she was not telling the truth,
but he saw by the light of genuine anger that sprang
to her eyes at his frown, that he had misjudged her.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," he said.  "How is your husband?"
</p>

<p>
She smiled again at once.  "About the same.
Will you wait?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"No thanks, I'll explore the country a bit, and call
back again."  He was going away when the woman
stopped him.  "Will you come in just a minute?
I'd like to try you with the cards!"
</p>

<p>
He looked at her enquiringly.  "Do you really
believe your cards?"
</p>

<p>
She did not answer, but stepped inside the caravan
and produced a pack of cards, quite new and clean.
"Shuffle and cut," she said, handing them to him.
</p>

<p>
He did so, and cut the ace of hearts.
</p>

<p>
"You're thinking of her."
</p>

<p>
"That's true.  I was thinking of her prophesying
in Scotland that I should be a winner."
</p>

<p>
She looked into his eyes.  "So you will," she
answered.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs felt his pulse tingle with an added
determination as she spoke.
</p>

<p>
Taking hold of him by the right wrist, she turned
the palm upwards and looked at it intently for a few
seconds.  "My word! you are a strong man," she
said.
</p>

<p>
"That's piffle," he answered, "those lines are
accentuated by gripping a hammer shaft."
</p>

<p>
She smiled.  "Oh no!  Cut again, please."
</p>

<p>
He cut twelve times, and cut hearts every time.
</p>

<p>
The old woman positively laughed.  "Now do you
believe?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"It's certainly rather a curious coincidence.
Hearts infer love, I suppose, and I'm in love, that's
true."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, that's true, but you have a rival, I know.
A dark man, perhaps&mdash;if he&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs frowned.  "Good God, that's impossible.
Didn't you hear what the old man said? he's her
brother."
</p>

<p>
The old woman looked steadily into his eyes.
"You don't know.  That's only what you think."
</p>

<p>
"Lord!  Perhaps you're right.  By Jove&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Cut the cards," she interrupted.  "Again and again."
</p>

<p>
He cut six times, spades every time, the knave four
times.
</p>

<p>
The gipsy was very serious.  "There!" she said.
</p>

<p>
"It's certainly rather curious," he admitted.
</p>

<p>
"That dark man's very close, closer than you
think.  Watch him!  Watch him!" she repeated,
and retreated into her caravan in a strangely
perturbed state.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs returned to Bounce.  "No luck," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Patience is a virtue, sir, so they says.  An'
you've got to 'ave it with the women, though they
ain't got none theirselves."
</p>

<p>
"You're a man of experience, Bounce."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I ain't got no more than one missus, an'
that's enough for any man, too much for some on 'em."
</p>

<p>
"You're very virtuous, I'm sure, I hope you get
your reward."
</p>

<p>
"That's true.  I do, sir.  Not but what I 'ave a'
done a bit o' courting now an' then in other
parts&mdash;before I was married, o' course."
</p>

<p>
"Of course."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  An' now my missus gets the benefit of all
that experience.  I come to 'er efficient, thoroughly
efficient, as I sez to 'er on the day that we was married."
</p>

<p>
"You are a thorough believer in efficiency, Bounce."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir.  Do it now, an' do it proper.  That's the
motto of the navy.  Only 'steady,' too.  'Steady does
it,' is another motto.  The man as ain't never done
no courting before 'e gets married, ought to be buried
an' not married at all."
</p>

<p>
"I've just had my fortune told by that gipsy woman."
</p>

<p>
"That ain't nothing, sir.  I've 'ad it done 'undreds
of times, an' all different," the little sailor remarked,
cheerfully.  "When I was in Calcutta&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
So listening to Bounce's wonderful adventures,
Carstairs had a very pleasant morning drive.  They
stopped at a little country public house and got some
bread and cheese and beer; Bounce, meanwhile,
enlarging on the virtue of beer in general, and that
beer in particular.
</p>

<p>
Then they got into the trap again and completed
a circuit of the locality, bringing up finally at the far
side of the little common.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo!" said Bounce.  "What's up there?"
</p>

<p>
They could see a dense crowd of navvies from the
water-works moving in the direction of the gipsy
camp.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs looked, anxiously.  "Hope there's no
row on with the gipsies," he said.  They could hear
much shouting and singing, but could not distinguish
the words.  A turn in the road brought the camp full
into view: there was much commotion going on, the
gipsies were pulling their caravans up together as if
to withstand an assault.
</p>

<p>
"We must stop those chaps, Bounce," Carstairs
said, as he whipped up the horse and tore along the
road at a furious gallop.  They cut across the level
strip of green at the acute angle of the common, and
raced along the other road.  They reached the navvies
some three hundred yards from the camp.  As they
got within earshot they could distinguish what the
men were shouting.  Carstairs flushed an angry red
and set his big jaw tight.  "And this is England,"
he said.  "England, in the year of grace 1896,
'England, the eye, the soul of Europe,' as Darwen
used to quote."
</p>

<p>
"What's started them on this devil's game, Bounce?"
</p>

<p>
"Drink, I expects!  Men gets like that sometimes."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs pulled the horse up dead in front of the
advance guard of the men.
</p>

<p>
"I say, where are all you chaps going?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Women," they shouted.  "Bring out the gipsy women."
</p>

<p>
"That won't do," he said, sharply.  "Go on back
about your business."
</p>

<p>
"Ho, ho, 'ere's Lord Muck," a cockney voice
shouted in derision.
</p>

<p>
"The Earl o' Hell," another one corrected.
</p>

<p>
They swarmed round the dogcart, and the others
coming up stopped to listen.
</p>

<p>
"How is it you are not at work?" Carstairs asked.
</p>

<p>
"Saturday afternoon, mister," a gruff, but civil
voice replied.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you'll all get the sack, you know, besides
imprisonment, if you go on with this game."
</p>

<p>
"The sack!  Ha!  Ha!  'Ere's a bloke going to
give us the sack, mates."
</p>

<p>
"That'll be nine 'undred and ninety-nine times wot
I've 'ad the sack, then."
</p>

<p>
"S'pose we'll 'ave to starve, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Same as we did afore, eh, mates? Ha! Ha!"
</p>

<p>
A man climbed up on to the step.  "What say we
goes for a drive?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The words were hardly out of his mouth when
Carstairs' fist took him in the face and knocked him
backwards among his fellows.
</p>

<p>
"Hurray!" they shouted.  "Hip, hip, hurray!"  Five
hundred of them roared it out in chorus.
</p>

<p>
"That's one for Charlie."
</p>

<p>
"You ain't going to take it lying down, Charlie?"
</p>

<p>
"'E's 'ad enough.  I allus said Charlie ain't got
no guts in 'im."
</p>

<p>
"'Old the 'orse while I gets at 'im," the man
answered.
</p>

<p>
Two navvies promptly seized the horse, one on each
side of his head.
</p>

<p>
"Up you get Charlie."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stood up.  "Wait a minute," he said.
"I'll come down.  Will you give me fair play?"
</p>

<p>
"That's honest, 'e couldn't say no fairer than that."
</p>

<p>
"Make a ring, mates."
</p>

<p>
"I'll 'old yer coat, Charlie."
</p>

<p>
"'Go's going to second the toff?"
</p>

<p>
Bounce stood up.  "Is there any blokes 'ere wot
bin in the navy?" he asked, with great dignity.
</p>

<p>
"'Blue Marines,' mate," a big, burly man on the
outskirts of the crowd answered.
</p>

<p>
Bounce looked at him closely.  "Is that you,
Scrapper Hiscocks?"
</p>

<p>
"That's me, mate."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you remember Jack Bounce, of the
'Mediterranean'?"
</p>

<p>
The big man pushed his way up to the trap and held
out his hand.  "How do! old chum.  I thought
you was still in the Service."
</p>

<p>
"So I ought a bin if I 'adn't bin a bleeding fool.
This 'ere gentleman is Mister Carstairs, 'e's good, I
trained 'im myself.  'E's nephew of Lootenant
Carstairs wot was on the 'Mediterranean' with us."
</p>

<p>
The man promptly saluted, and Carstairs nodded
to him.  "I shall get a fair show?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
The ex-marine nodded towards Bounce.  "Me an'
Bull-dog'll see to that, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks!"  He stood up and addressed the crowd
with a smiling countenance.  "Look here, you chaps,
I'm going to take on your mate here for as many rounds
as you like, or to a finish."
</p>

<p>
"To a finish," they shouted in chorus.
</p>

<p>
"Alright; to a finish, then, but we may as well
have a gamble on it."
</p>

<p>
"'Ear!  'Ear!  That's sporting."
</p>

<p>
"Well, look here.  I'll put my purse containing
five pounds in the hands of this gentleman.  (He
pointed to the marine, who blushed.)
</p>

<p>
"Mister Hiscocks," some one remarked.
</p>

<p>
There was a general titter, the navvy is unaccustomed
to any sort of a handle to his name.
</p>

<p>
"That's it.  If I lose, that five pounds will be yours
to buy drinks with.  If I win, will you promise
to go back and leave those women alone?"
</p>

<p>
"That's fair, mates.  'E couldn't say no fairer
than that," the marine remarked.
</p>

<p>
"Ay.  'O's going to watch you an' the five pounds,
Bill?"
</p>

<p>
There was a general laugh.
</p>

<p>
"What do you say?" Carstairs asked.
</p>

<p>
"What does Charlie think on it?" a voice asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, let Charlie decide," they chorused.
</p>

<p>
"Well, mates," Charlie spoke up, "I thinks wot
the bloke sez is fair.  I'll do my best for you, mates."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs climbed out of the trap.  "That's settled
then," he said.
</p>

<p>
Bounce led the horse on to the green, and tied him
up to a little tree.  "Let's have a proper ring, and
half a dozen stewards to see there ain't no crowding."
</p>

<p>
They selected a level spot in a little dell surrounded
by miniature mountains.  "'Cos then everybody can
see without shoving," a navvy observed.  The six
stewards, with an air of very great seriousness, took
off their coats and rolled up their shirt sleeves,
exposing brawny, sunburnt arms to the daylight.
They formed a circle and roughly measured with their
eyes.  "How's that, Charlie?  How'll that do, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Alright, mates," Charlie said.
</p>

<p>
"Very nicely, thanks," Carstairs replied.
</p>

<p>
They stepped inside the circle, and Bounce and
Hiscocks assisted Carstairs to disrobe, while five
hundred statuesque navvies crowded round the tiers
of the natural theatre, five hundred hard, strong faces;
high cheek-boned, square-jawed, steady-eyed.  Many
of them were exceedingly handsome, in a massive,
rough-hewn sort of way; mahogany browned, ear-ringed,
coarse skinned.  They were gathered there
for a brutal, coarse purpose, perhaps, but the dawning
of a great truth was uppermost, resolute and steadfast,
in the minds of most.  They were going to see fair
play, "fair play" with all it meant when all the
passions of envy, hatred, fierce anger, and the lust
of gain were aroused.  They were sportsmen, these
men, and the term always seems to me synonymous
with gentlemen as understood in England.  The germ
of a desire to do right was firmly fixed in their hearts,
and this absorbed through many generations from the
force of the precept and example of their leaders, the
aristocrats of England.  They had no religion, these
men, and no politics, but the spirit of the prize ring
and the Queensberry rules was deeply implanted
in their souls.  Their fathers before them had
imbibed these rules from constant practical demonstration.
Those drunken, dissolute, Georgian noblemen
had given these men a code of morals that they could
understand, and firmly rooted it in their breasts by
consistent example.  And every day England reaps
the fruit of that seed.  Truly it seems to me that
England owes more to the sportsman than to the
statesman: and although the middle class swamp,
by a vast majority, all other classes in the number
of great men they have produced: yet the aristocracy,
like the head boys of a school, are responsible
for the "tone" of the nation, and the "tone" of
England is surpassing good.  What these men had
started out to do that day was due to their mental
limitation, not to their wilful vice.  Woman,
particularly that type of woman, was to them an inferior
animal, as she is to most working men; yet the
majority treat their female relations, and the women
they consider worthy of it (and the working man is
not easily deceived by fine clothes and fine manners),
with astonishing respect, real and true respect, not
superficial mannerisms.  The big majority of English
working men, in my experience, are sportsmen, and
possessed of the instincts of gentlemen, ineradicably
stamped into their hard, true natures.  And you young
men, the budding engineers, who are lost in the
intricacies of elementary algebra, or unravelling those
painful problems in strength of material; the Tensile
stresses in the rims of flywheels, and the elastic limit
of steel plates, etc.: it is yours to see that you also
understand the elastic limit of human nature, the
inherent instincts of the working man, and the
durability of your own emotions; this is what you learn
in the "shops": it is yours to solve the unemployed
problem and see that the English workman gets a
chance to develop the fine qualities that are in him;
for this (unemployment) is an engineering problem;
the reduction of a sine curve to a straight line, the
modification of a wave, the control of a tide: it is
yours to know that the working man does not want
a mouth in Parliament, but a fair show at his work.
Watch what he <i>does</i>, and not what he <i>says</i>, as he will
watch what you do, and not what you say; then you
will see that he is (mostly) a sportsman, and you will
learn to understand that it is better that the accent
should be on the "<i>man</i>" than on the "gentle"&mdash;yet
do not forget that a clean mind is the basis of all true
force of character, and is inherently respected by every
Englishman, foul-mouthed though he be.  And you,
fond Mammas, who desire your dear boys to be
engineers, see to it that their biceps are good, for this
is the underlying principle of all work; and when
dear Willie comes home from the "shops" with his
face punched into a many-hued polyhedron, be not
alarmed, this is no doubt the result of scientific
research into the specific resistance of the fitter's mate;
it is also conceivable that occasions may arise when it
is good that Willie should stand in the police court
dock, charged with breaking a man's head with a
hammer.  All these things must come to pass before
the steel enters thoroughly into Willie's soul; then
he will take a very high polish and be very reliable,
yet he will be very flexible and very keen; for this
is the age of steel&mdash;hard, keen, true steel.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stripped to the waist and tied his trousers
round with a scarf that Bounce lent him.  He stepped
into the middle of the ring and looked at his opponent:
slightly shorter, but more massive than himself, his
face was remarkably hard looking, with a short, clipped
moustache, and light china blue eyes with a roving,
happy-go-lucky look in them; even now, as Carstairs
faced him, there was an element of a grin on his face.
(It is written somewhere in the Book of Fate that the
British navvy shall fear no man on this earth.)  His
neck was like the trunk of an oak tree and sloped
grandly on to his massive shoulders; in his hands,
Carstairs observed, Nature had endowed him with a
pair of very formidable weapons, the knuckles were
enormous.  Altogether Jack Carstairs recognised that
he was up against one of the stiffest propositions he
had ever tackled in his life.
</p>

<p>
"Are you ready, sir?" he asked, with quite a
genial smile.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," Carstairs answered.
</p>

<p>
"Three minute rounds," Bounce said, taking out
the fine, half-hunter watch that had been presented
to him for rescuing a drowning man.
</p>

<p>
The two combatants agreed.
</p>

<p>
"Shake hands, then."  They reached out and
gripped each other with a strong, hearty grip, and five
hundred heads nodded grave approval.
</p>

<p>
"Now!  Time!"
</p>

<p>
As soon as the word was out of Bounce's mouth,
the navvy sprang at Carstairs like a tiger.  The
royal light of battle was in his eyes, there was
positive joy written large and bold over all his
countenance.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was serious, very serious, and quite calm;
he ducked the man's furious left and right straight
drives, and got in a useful stop hit with his left in the
face, then broke ground.  But the navvy was on him
again like a whirlwind, while five hundred gruff voices
shouted.
</p>

<p>
"One for the toff.  First blood for the toff.  'Is
nose is bleeding.  Don't forget that five pound,
Charlie.  Mind, your mates is watching you."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs felt the huge, bony fists whistle past his
ears, and he ducked and ducked again to the furious
straight drives.  He began to smile, too; the pleasure
of it was entering into him, the important issue was
slipping away from his mind.  He hit the navvy
heavily about the face, and received one or two
glancing blows himself.
</p>

<p>
When time was called, they stood and looked at
each other for a second or so like two newly found
friends.
</p>

<p>
"That was good, wasn't it, sir?" the navvy said.
</p>

<p>
"You do make the pace," Carstairs answered, with
genuine admiration.
</p>

<p>
The man stroked his nose tenderly.  "Same to you,
sir," he said, with a grin.
</p>

<p>
Their seconds came and took them away to their
corners and sat them down on one man's knees while
another fanned them with big, red pocket
handkerchiefs.
</p>

<p>
"'It 'im in the body," Bounce whispered.  "You
could 'it 'im in the clock all day, an' 'e'd on'y think
you was tickling of 'im."
</p>

<p>
"Time" was called, and the navvy held out his
hand again just to show that they were still on the
best of good terms.  Carstairs grasped it warmly, and
again the five hundred heads nodded strong approval.
They stepped back a pace and the navvy said: "Are
you ready?"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs said "Yes," and promptly the man sprang
in, letting drive furiously right and left.  There was a
sameness about his methods, and he swung his shoulders
freely and openly before each hit, so that Carstairs
knew exactly where and when they were coming, and
dodged them easily; he ducked low to the left, and
got in a swinging right on the short ribs.  The man
grunted, his breath had been short before.  He
stopped and took a deep breath, Carstairs magnanimously
standing clear of him; then he rushed again,
and Carstairs got him in the same place; again he
took a deep breath and rushed, exhaustion was making
him slower.  Carstairs ducked to the right this time,
and got in a beautiful left, fairly and squarely on the
solar plexus.  The man dropped like a log, and lay
gasping.
</p>

THE MAN DROPPED LIKE A LOG
</p>

<p>
There was a wild uproar, several of the men tried
to break into the ring to pick him up, but the stewards
thrust them roughly back.  "Don't break the ring,"
they said.  Bounce stood over him, watch in hand,
and counted out the seconds.  "He's beat," he said
at the end of the tenth, as the man lay there helpless.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs picked him up.  "Never mind," he said.
"That five pounds is yours, anyway."
</p>

<p>
The navvies shouted uproariously, and crowded
round Carstairs congratulating him in their rough
but sincere fashion.  In the midst of it all he heard
an old familiar voice that drove the smile from his face.
</p>

<p>
"That really was damn good, old chap."
</p>

<p>
He turned and beheld Darwen, smiling, genial,
standing at his elbow.
</p>

<p>
"How the devil did you get here?" he asked,
frowning severely.
</p>

<p>
The navvies near listened in open curiosity and
wonder.
</p>

<p>
"'E bin down 'ere weeks, off an' on, standing us
beer down at the village," a navvy explained.
</p>

<p>
"So this was some of your devil's work, eh?  You
were going to resort to force when fair means failed,
you damned skunk."
</p>

<p>
The navvies listened in silent wonder.
</p>

<p>
Darwen shrugged his shoulders with easy unconcern.
"The forces of Nature, dear boy," he answered.
He turned to the navvies.  "I came down to see the
fun," he said.  "The gipsies are going to put up a
scrap, I see, they're out with sticks and guns and God
knows what."
</p>

<p>
"That's off, Mister," a navvy answered.
</p>

<p>
"Off?  Ha!  Ha!  You've let this chap with his
little fight divert you?"
</p>

<p>
"That was part of the stakes," Carstairs said, shortly.
"And these men will stick to their bargain."
</p>

<p>
They gave a low murmur of assent.
</p>

<p>
Darwen laughed.  "Well, you are mugs, you've let
this chap diddle you.  This skilled fighter against poor
old plucky, but unskilled Charlie."
</p>

<p>
They began to cast suspicious glances at Carstairs.
</p>

<p>
"Charlie didn't get one good one on him.  You could
see that for yourselves."
</p>

<p>
"It was a fair fight," they said, gruffly.  "An' a
bet's a bet."
</p>

<p>
"That's right; fair is fair all the world over," he
was talking to them in their own language, "but it
isn't fair for a trained man, practising every day, to
take advantage of a plucky sort of chap like Charlie,
now is it?"
</p>

<p>
There was silence.
</p>

<p>
"A bet is a bet," he repeated, "but it's not sporting
to bet on a cert.  'All bets off' in that case is the
rule," he said.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was slowly dressing; he stopped with his
collar in his hand.  "That man is a rogue and a liar," he
said, "he doesn't know the meaning of the term sport."
</p>

<p>
"Ha!  Ha!  Hear that.  Ask him if he'd take me
on the same terms that he took Charlie on?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, here and now," Carstairs answered, starting
to undress again.  "And glad of the chance."
</p>

<p>
The navvies cheered.  "'Ear.  'Ear.  That's a
toff, that's sport.  Clear the ring, mates.  Let the
two toffs set to."
</p>

<p>
The stewards cleared the ring again, the navvies
stepped back in expectant silence, they expected
something exceptional this time.  Charlie stepped up
to Carstairs.  "I'll be your second, mister.  Let this
yer bloke (pointing to Bounce) be referee."  He was
as brisk and lively as ever again.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," Carstairs said.  "You and I must have
a drink together before I go back."
</p>

<p>
Charlie grinned with real pleasure.  "Thank ye,
sir," he said.
</p>

<p>
Darwen stripped with alacrity, his big brown eyes
gleamed with abnormal joy: there was sufficient of
the Gaul in him to make him "More than man before
the fight.  Less than woman afterwards."  He was
attended to by two navvies; a tall red-headed man
and a slender dark man with rather a thoughtful,
melancholy cast of countenance.  A young gipsy
youth, slouch-hatted, slovenly, wandered up to the
group, and stood beside Darwen for a minute or two;
his piercing eyes moved with a quick alert expression
under the wide drooping brim of his hat; his face was
very dirty and his hands thrust deep into his trousers'
pockets.  The navvies took no notice of him, and he
wandered nonchalantly across the ring and took up a
position near Carstairs.
</p>

<p>
"How many rounds?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"To a finish," Bounce answered.
</p>

<p>
"I'll put a bob on this 'un, he's got the look
of a winner," he growled out in a surly, gruff
voice.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs glanced up at him quickly, but he turned
round and sauntered off.
</p>

<p>
"Get ready."
</p>

<p>
They stepped out into the ring, two splendid
specimens of English manhood.  Darwen six feet in his
socks, and Carstairs half an inch shorter.  They were
in the pink of condition, and both of them full of
steam.  Somewhere near at hand was the girl they
both wanted, and they had this in mind.  Darwen,
for the first time in his life, was in love, really in love,
with all the ardour of his passionate nature.
</p>

<p>
"Shake hands," Darwen's seconds called, but
Carstairs took no notice, and the five hundred
spectators settled themselves to witness a battle of real
hatred.
</p>

<p>
"Time," Bounce called.
</p>

<p>
Promptly Darwen sprang in with a realistic feint,
then, smiling, broke ground and worked round his
antagonist.  Carstairs watched him, keeping the
centre of the ring, pivoting slowly on his own axis.
Darwen sprang in again with another feint, but still
Carstairs gave no opening, then quick as a flash
Darwen gave a left lead and followed up with a heavy
right swing; both got home, though not with their
full effect.
</p>

<p>
Darwen was at the zenith of a strong man's powers;
his head was singularly clear, and his speed almost
supernatural.  There was a sort of feline fascination
about him, his eyes, too, were something catlike, or
snakey; there was an undulating ease in his movements
that was beautiful, fascinating; he had risen
to the sort of hysterical height which the Latins seem
capable of, and still the English blood in him kept
him cool.  As he stood, that day, he was almost the
perfect, scientific fighter.  He feinted with wonderful
expression, he "drew" Carstairs' leads with
extremely skilful acting, and timed his counters
marvellously.  At the end of the round, Carstairs was
battered and bruised, but Darwen was as fresh as
a daisy.
</p>

<p>
The navvies maintained a glum silence; this feinting
and drawing savoured, to them, of deceit, and
the way Carstairs took his punishment, melted their
hearts.  The ex-marine whispered in his ear: "steady
does it, stick to 'im."
</p>

<p>
The young gipsy reappeared from the crowd.  "My
money's still on this 'un," he said.
</p>

<p>
Next round, Carstairs attacked, persistently, all
the time; his wind was good and he knew it; from
his earliest infancy he had led a spotlessly clean and
wholesome life, and he was sound as a bell from the
crown of his head to the sole of his foot; he was alert
and quick too, but it was the staccato briskness of the
terrier, and his eyes were the eyes of an Englishman,
an engineer.  With a fine disregard of punishment,
he hustled Darwen through the whole of the round.
</p>

<p>
The navvies buzzed with excitement, and the young
gipsy had to be turned out of the ring by the stewards.
</p>

<p>
Darwen's seconds performed their office enthusiastically,
but their sympathies were really with the
other man.
</p>

<p>
For four rounds Carstairs took all the punishment
steadily.  He bored in all the time, attacking persistently,
never once had he feinted or tried to keep away.
Darwen's smile began to fade, he was getting angry.
This man was such a fool that apparently he could
not see that he was beaten.  There was a devilish
gleam of temper in his eyes as they faced each other
for the fifth round.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs' left foot and left fist moved in the old,
old way.  Instead of steadily countering as he had
been doing, Darwen dashed in to hustle matters to a
close.  Next minute Bounce was standing over him
counting out the seconds.  For the first time in the
fight Carstairs had feinted&mdash;and successfully.
</p>

<p>
The navvies cheered fervidly.
</p>

<p>
At the seventh second, Darwen jumped up furiously
and sprang at Carstairs like a fiend incarnate.  "You
devil," he screamed, "I'll kill you."
</p>

<p>
But he didn't.  Carstairs knocked him down again, and
he lay like a log.  Still he was up again before the last
second was counted.  It was astonishing where he got
the power from, but he rushed in again like a whirlwind.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs, cool and precise, but very quick, his grey
eyes hard as steel, jabbed him off, and off, and off,
till he saw what he wanted, then his wide shoulders
swept a half circle in the air, swinging cleanly from
the hips; his great, strong, right leg, trailing to the
rear like a stay, braced itself suddenly rigid; and
the right fist, tightly clenched at the moment of
impact, shot out clean and true in a perfectly straight
line to the point of Darwen's eagerly extended jaw:
it was a perfect blow, showing a beautiful, smooth
ripple as one muscle after the other took up its task;
then remaining rigid like a statue for one second, with
lips firmly closed, and the eyes&mdash;the entire expression
of the face, full of definite, resolute purpose;
Carstairs for that second seemed more than a man.  None
but a man with his long record of clean living and
strict training could have risen to such a blow after
receiving such a pounding as he had.
</p>

<p>
Darwen dropped for the last time.
</p>

<p>
There was a tense silence as Bounce stood over him,
the tenth second was called and still he lay there;
his seconds picked him up and dabbed his face with
a wet handkerchief; slowly the light of intelligence
returned to his eyes.  He sat up and looked round.
There was a subdued cheer; the navvies were unusually
moved, they felt, somehow, that this was more than
an ordinary fight, every one was still for fully a minute,
the silence was oppressive.  God knows what was
passing in those five hundred rugged minds.  Carstairs
himself was strangely impressed; in after life
he never forgot it.  He felt, he said, as though he had
come suddenly to the last peak of a majestic mountain,
and saw a wondrous valley spread out below him.
</p>

<p>
Darwen's seconds stood behind him holding up his
shoulders.  They were quite still, they said no word
as he looked slowly and vacantly round; then,
without warning, he bent his head forward into his
hands and wept like a child.
</p>

<p>
A beaten man is the most pathetic sight in all
Nature: these men were used to death, they had
seen their bosom chums killed, squashed flat by falling
rocks, buried alive in the earth, mangled by machinery;
but when Darwen wept they turned their heads.
</p>

<p>
The young gipsy moved up to Carstairs, as he stood
alone, and whispered in his ear: "I knew you'd win.
You'll always win, win whatever you want."  A
small hand reached out and dropped an emerald ring
on to the little heap of his clothes over which he was
bending; as he put out his hand to pick it up, he felt
the pressure of warm, soft lips on his cheek.  He
started up in amazement, but the gipsy had melted
into the crowd like a shadow.  One or two of the
navvies who had seen it grinned from ear to ear, and
Carstairs blushed from his forehead to his neck.
</p>

<p>
"That was a girl," a navvy said.  "I thought he
was slim like, too."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs said nothing, but dressed very quickly.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
</h3>

<p>
Bounce had seen that little incident, too.  He
crossed the ring and helped Carstairs to dress.
He said nothing, but his peculiar hazel eyes were
alight.
</p>

<p>
While they were still busy, the little civil engineer
from the water-works appeared on the scene.  He
looked round in surprise.  "What the blazes are you
chaps doing here?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
A navvy answered from the crowd.  "A fight, sir."  The
whole assembly had the air of school boys caught
breaking bounds.
</p>

<p>
The little man blazed with anger.  "Damn it,"
he said, "why didn't you tell me?  You know I like
to see that everything is above board at these little
gatherings."  He stood on the top of the little hill
clear to the view of all.
</p>

<p>
"Beg parding, sir.  This 'ere were sort of impromptoo."
</p>

<p>
"Impromptu!  By Jove&mdash;you know I don't like
impromptu fights."
</p>

<p>
"Very sorry, sir," the spokesman muttered, and
they all looked it.  By sheer force of character and
unswerving fairness of treatment, this little man had
obtained, in the course of two years' constant
association, a complete ascendency over these wild, strong
men.
</p>

<p>
"Who's been fighting?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Charlie Moore an' a toff bloke, then two toff
blokes."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," he said, in a completely changed tone, and
made his way quickly to where Carstairs was.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was dressed and just moving off, "My
name is Carstairs.  I'm an engineer too, electrical
and mechanical.  I'm staying at the Blue Boar in
the village, I have an engagement now.  If you will
call there this evening, I shall be pleased to have a
talk with you."
</p>

<p>
"But what's the fight about?  Have my men been
molesting you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no."  Carstairs looked round, the navvies
were beginning to move off hurriedly.  He did not
want to get them into trouble, still he was not good
at lying.  "I was to blame," he said.  "We had a
difference of opinion and settled it in the
time-honoured way; they behaved like gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
The little man's eyes sparkled.  He looked round,
but the last of the five hundred was disappearing
hurriedly, like a cart horse colt over the hillock.  He
laughed aloud.  "They're just damn great kids! those
chaps, but the very best.  I shan't be able to
get within earshot of one of 'em till Monday morning
now.  They'll shun me like the plague."  He laughed
again.  "By George they are rum chaps.  About
the first week they were here there was a violent row
with the old farmer on the hill there."  He pointed
to a farm house in the distance.  "They went
rabbiting with dogs and ferrets right in front of his
house; when he expostulated, they were going to pull
his place to pieces.  He sent for me.  I couldn't stop
their poaching, of course, nobody could; but I
objected to their threatening the man.  'Well, sir,'
they said (it was that man Moore by the way), 'what
beat us was the cheek o' the beggar coming an' talking
to <i>three</i> on us.'  He didn't speak to <i>one</i> of them
afterwards, poor chap, he was frightened out of his wits;
they're a mean sort of swine, farmers.  Fancy grousing
about a blooming rabbit."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs laughed.  "How about the woods over
there?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't think there's much left in 'em now.
The keepers keep away when my chaps are about."  The
little man laughed.  "They have elaborate
shooting parties with plenty of beer, and about six
old guns between 'em.  Take it in turns for a shot.
Gravely presented me with a pair of pheasants once,
and got quite shirty when I wouldn't have 'em;
couldn't understand that they were stolen.  'Why!
the keeper seen us,' they explained.  'If he'd been
a wise man he would have not seen you,' I said.
'Will 'e 'ave a trout then, mister?'  'No thanks,'
I said.  'Well, I'm beggared,' they answered, and
went away growling.  They still think I'm a bit
mad."
</p>

<p>
They laughed together and strolled on.  Carstairs
was obviously impatient, but the little man did not
see it.  He only met men with a soul above beer at
very rare intervals.
</p>

<p>
"Damn funny chaps, you know, but the best, the
very best, at heart.  Don't care tuppence for anybody,
and quite fail to see why they should.  'When
my 'at's on, my roof's on, an' off I goes,' they say.
They wander up and get a start, work for a day,
'sub' a 'bob,' and slope off.  Sometimes a man will
start one day, and next a policeman arrives, and the
man is missing, two or three more with him very likely.
Damn funny chaps.  What for?  Oh, nothing serious
as a rule, pinching a pair of boots from a shop window,
or something like that, you know; I had a man
murdered once, though; not here&mdash;up in the midlands,
had a hole knocked in his head with a pick axe,
never found out who did it.  There are black sheep
in every flock, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Men are about the same as any other machine,
I think, you get out rather less than you put in.
Breed simply means efficiency and reliability."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  By Jove, that's so.  Look here, come up to
my digs, will you?  What! an engagement.  Oh,
I see.  Well, ta-ta for the present."
</p>

<p>
They were quite close to the caravan, and the little
man looked at Carstairs curiously as he saw where
he was going.  He made no comment, but turned
and made his way back to the village.
</p>

<p>
The camp was quite silent, the vans were all drawn
up together in the form of a square.  The dogs and
children all seemed to have disappeared.  Carstairs
went up the steps of the caravan, and knocked at
the little door.  He began to wonder vaguely if the
gipsies had all deserted the place, till he caught sight
of the crown of a hat and the muzzle of a gun on
the roof of a caravan.
</p>

<p>
The door was very quietly opened by the old woman
(she was in ragged male attire), and her eyes gleamed
like an eagle's in the sunlight as she looked at
Carstairs.  She put a hand on his shoulder.  "Well done,
well done," she said.
</p>

<p>
He put her hand gently aside.  "Where is your
daughter?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Gone to London," she answered.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs frowned like a thunder-storm.  "Confound
it!  She gave me this ring about two minutes
ago."
</p>

<p>
The woman smiled and looked at the ring.  "Yes,
that's her mother's.  Don't lose it."
</p>

<p>
"Yours?" he said.  "What's she bolted away
again for?"
</p>

<p>
She positively laughed, and Carstairs turned to go
away.  She stopped him with a hand on his shoulder.
"I'm not her mother," she said.
</p>

<p>
"What!  Then who is?"
</p>

<p>
"Lady Cleeve's sister.  She's dead."
</p>

<p>
"Holy God!  But that man&mdash;Sir Thomas, said&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He didn't know and didn't care much.  She's his
child, but not mine; mine died, and we stole this one.
God forgive me!  She's been more than a daughter to
me.  And he&mdash;he was always drunk, always drunk
when he wasn't playing the fiddle, always drunk.
And now he's dead."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" Carstairs said; it was all he could think of
at the time.
</p>

<p>
The gipsy woman sat on the top step of the little
ladder, her head in her hands, crooning to herself.
"My God!  My God!  And now he's dead!  He
charmed me with his singing and his playing, and he
was in the gutter playing for coppers and drink, while
his lawful wife lay dying in her mother's home.  Oh,
my God! my God!"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs stood in wonder; he did not know whether
to stay or go.  She took no notice of him, but crooned
on, rocking herself from side to side.  "And now he's
dead.  Dead!  Him that opened the gates of Heaven
with his fiddle! dead and along with her, but I shall
have him; he's mine, mine, and there's another.  O
my God!  My God! but I'm going too!  I shall be
the first."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs tapped her on the shoulder.  "Pull yourself
together," he said.  "Shall I get you some brandy?"
</p>

<p>
"Brandy?  No! that's been the curse of it all."  She
raised her head and glared at him with eyes like
live coals.  "I stole this child, his child, that ought
to have been brought up in the lap of luxury, I stole
her and brought her up like a gipsy to try and bring
him back."  She dropped her head into her hands
again and wailed.  "God forgive me!  God forgive me!"
</p>

<p>
He shook her quite roughly.  "It's no use groaning
now," he said, "try and make amends.  Have you
told the girl who she is?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, to-day, and gave her the ring.  All there is
to prove it."
</p>

<p>
"Is that why she left you, then?"  Carstairs could
hardly believe it, remembering the affection the girl
had always shown for this woman whom she believed
to be her mother.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, she kissed me like an angel from heaven.
It's you, you who made her leave."
</p>

<p>
"Me! but she's just given me this ring, and&mdash;and
she kissed me too."
</p>

<p>
The woman looked up at him again, but her eyes
were now dim with tears.  "You don't understand,
she's very proud, prouder than that old man who's
just dead.  She'll come for that ring some day."
</p>

<p>
"No!  By God, she won't.  I'll find her, and take
it to her."  He pulled out a card.  "Look here, that's
my address.  If I don't find her before I go back next
week, will you send me her address, or any news of
her you may have?"
</p>

<p>
"I shall be dead in a month; it's no use leaving
me this."
</p>

<p>
"What's the use of talking rot like that?" he said,
angrily.  "Are you going to help me?"
</p>

<p>
"No," she answered simply.
</p>

<p>
He turned and left her without another word.
"Bounce," he said, as he climbed into the dog-cart,
"you've had some experience.  Are all women mad?"
</p>

<p>
"Every one on 'em, sir.  That is, them wots any
good."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Well, let her go like hell for Southville."
</p>

<p>
On the way they passed the little civil engineer.
"Hullo!" he shouted, "are you off, then?"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs pulled up.  "Yes, jump up and come on
into Southville with me, I want some one to swear at."
</p>

<p>
"Ha!  That's it, is it?"  He climbed in.  "What
else are you going to do with me?"
</p>

<p>
"Put you up for the week-end, swear at you all day,
Sunday, and send you back about your business on
Monday."
</p>

<p>
"Well, half a minute; let's go via my digs&mdash;that
farm over there&mdash;and I'll collect some togs."
</p>

<p>
"Not a sock or a pyjama.  Come as you are, and
we'll go to church to-morrow, yellow leggings, and all.
I want you to be best man."
</p>

<p>
"This is rather sudden, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, the only obstacle is whether I can
catch the bride in time."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I see, but there's some formality about banns,
and living in the parish, and so on."
</p>

<p>
"My dear fellow, I'm a parson's son."
</p>

<p>
"I might have known that by your command of
swear words.  So am I."
</p>

<p>
"Is that so?  I might have known that too by
your perverted morals.  Never saw such an indignant
chap as you when you thought those navvies had
cheated you out of a fight."
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  By Jove, I shall wake those chaps up
about that on Monday."
</p>

<p>
They all three laughed.
</p>

<p>
"The bride is along this road somewhere; she's
only got about twenty minutes or half an hour's
start.  We're bound to catch her, and then, by Jove!
I'll gag and bind her if she won't come quietly."
</p>

<p>
"They never do that," Bounce said, wagging his
head sagely.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Bounce, if you sit up there croaking
away like some old raven, I'll chuck you out of the
cart."
</p>

<p>
"Very sorry, sir, but fax is fax, ain't 'em?"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs turned to the civil engineer.  "They call
him Bull-dog Bounce," he explained, "it's no use
arguing with him.  By the way, I don't know your
name.  Mine's Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
"Whitworth.  Jack Whitworth."
</p>

<p>
"Jack.  I'm a Jack, too.  So is Bounce here.
That's strange."
</p>

<p>
"No, sir.  Beggin' your pardon, sir.  A. E. Bounce,
sir.  Algernon Edward Bounce, A.B.  That's how
it's writ down in the Service books."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course, so you told me before.  I'd
forgotten.  I'm sorry."
</p>

<p>
The little civil engineer was inclined to smile till
he glanced at Bounce's perfectly serious face, then he
stared straight ahead, and they drove in silence for
some time.
</p>

<p>
As they neared the outskirts of Southville and still
saw no signs of the girl on the road, Carstairs got angry.
"I wonder if that woman lied to me," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
They drove on till they reached the hotel.  "No
luck this journey," he said, with a resigned smile.
"Come on in and have a drink, Bounce."  They held
a council of war in the smoking room.  Whitworth
raised his brows in wonder at the tale which was
partially disclosed to him.
</p>

<p>
"The curse of it is, I've got to go up north again on
Wednesday," Carstairs said.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that is awkward.  I'll keep an eye on the
camp for you, and let you know if the girl's there, or
if that dark chap is hanging around."
</p>

<p>
"Mister Darwen's 'ad enough I expect, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Not he, Bounce.  He'll turn up smiling again."
</p>

<p>
Bounce left them shortly afterwards, and the two
engineers, after partaking of a substantial meal,
strolled round the town, particularly the railway
station part of it, in the hope of meeting the girl.
At about ten o'clock they went home and went
straight to bed, they had both had a busy day,
particularly Carstairs.
</p>

<p>
The hotel was old fashioned and very comfortable,
but the resources in the way of bedrooms were strictly
limited, partly due to the reputation of the place.
Anyhow that evening the only bedroom they had to
offer for Whitworth was a small one right at the top
of an obscure wing of the building.  Carstairs said
nothing, but had his own luggage taken up there,
and gave Whitworth his room, fairly large, close to
a bathroom and over-looking a nicely kept lawn and
shrubbery.  He saw him installed in it, supplying his
wants as much as possible from his own portmanteau.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry I brought you away in such a hurry."
</p>

<p>
"That's alright, I'm used to roughing it.  It's
quite a treat to me to have the electric light in my room
and listen to the traffic outside.  I feel like a kid on a
holiday in London."
</p>

<p>
"Hope you'll sleep alright.  Good night."
</p>

<p>
"Trust me for that.  Good night."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was soon in bed and asleep, but it was
still dark when in his obscure corner of the building
he became aware of some sort of commotion going on
downstairs; he had a sort of vague impression that
he had been awakened by a cry.  He lay for a moment
and heard a police whistle blown violently, and a
voice shouting, "Police!  Police!"
</p>

<p>
He sprang out of bed, hurriedly donned a few
garments, and wound his way along tortuous passages
to the entrance hall.  Whitworth was standing there
(the centre of a group) in shirt and trousers, with a
small bedroom poker in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"What's the trouble?" Carstairs asked.
</p>

<p>
"Trouble!  By Gad!"  The little man was red as
a turkey cock and furiously angry.  "Some damned
swine tried to rob me, came in through the window.
I was awake and heard him climbing up, wondered
what it was.  The window was open&mdash;I always sleep
with it open&mdash;he pushed up the bottom sash and got
inside, then I switched on the light and went for him.
Look here!" he stretched his neck and pulled down
the collar of his shirt showing finger marks still there.
"He had no boots or stockings on; he took me by
the throat and held me off, with one foot shoved into
the pit of my stomach.  I was as helpless as a kid.
His arms were so long I was quite clear of him, and he
was as strong as a tiger.  Then&mdash;what do you think? he
looked in my face a minute, and chucked me across
the room.  Look here," he exposed a bruised elbow.
"I grabbed the poker, and he hopped out of the
window like a monkey.  I'll swear he was more like
a monkey than anything I've ever seen; he was
doubled up, hunchbacked, and his head tilted upwards
all the time.  His hands were below his knees;
he jumped from all fours.  Most hideous brute I've
ever seen.  I ran to the window, intending to chuck
the poker at him, but he was gone; whether up or
down, I couldn't say."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs listened in silence, his face was very grave.
A policeman arrived, and took profuse notes.  "Hunchback,"
he said.  "There was a gang here about three
year ago with a hunchback bloke."
</p>

<p>
Then the excitement abated, and the few male
visitors who had come out half dressed, to ascertain
the cause of the trouble, wandered back to bed.  The
engineers did likewise.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs, before getting into bed, carefully examined
the room; he locked the door, wedged the window,
and put his big pocket knife under his pillow.  Then
he slept like a top, for he was at heart a fatalist, and
felt that nothing would happen that night, and he
was right.  The morning broke bright and clear,
and he and Whitworth were down to breakfast
early.
</p>

<p>
The little man chatted away merrily about his
adventure as he disposed of a very liberal breakfast.
"The cheek of the swine, to try and rob me!" he said,
with unbounded astonishment and indignation, so
that Carstairs smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have imbibed the spirit of your
navvies pretty well."
</p>

<p>
Whitworth laughed.  "By Gad, if I'd got that
poker a second or two sooner, I'd have flattened him
out.  Wish old Hiscocks had been there.  He's my
sort of body servant, chain-bearer, carries the
instruments, and that sort of thing, one of the finest
men on top of this earth, sixteen stone odd, and no
stomach; he'd have flattened that chap to a pulp,
he's been in the marine artillery."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know.  Bounce knocked him out in a
ten-round contest in Japan."
</p>

<p>
"What!"  Whitworth dropped his knife and fork
in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"That's right, because I remember my uncle telling
me about it."
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!  That little Bounce.  Well, I'm hanged."
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap, Bounce is invincible.  You ought
to have seen him chuck a seven-foot policeman out of
the works in this town one night."
</p>

<p>
Whitworth went on with his breakfast with a business
like air.  "I must find a job for Bounce," he said,
decidedly.  "What's his pay now?"
</p>

<p>
"That's been arranged; he's coming up north with
me, driving on the test plate.  He's worth his weight
in gold there, so prompt, clear-headed, and reliable."
</p>

<p>
"Mean swine!  Fancy keeping a man like that
indoors driving dirty engines, he ought to be outside
in the sun and the rain with the birds and the flowers."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs laughed.  "When you've finished grubbing
we'll get outside with the flowers and the birds,"
he said.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after they sallied forth together and went
for a brisk walk in the country.  Coming back they
were just in time for the people trooping out of church,
and who should they meet but Darwen, prayer book
in hand, smiling, gay, as usual.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, there's that chap&mdash;" Whitworth commenced.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  He's probably the biggest sweep unhung, but
I know his mother, and I must have a word with him."
</p>

<p>
Darwen held out his hand.  "May I presume to
congratulate you on a good score yesterday?" he said.
</p>

<p>
"I was lucky," Carstairs answered, ignoring the
hand.  Whitworth strolled on.
</p>

<p>
Darwen still smiled.  "I can't allow that, my dear
chap.  You were good, scientific.  I ought to have
known you were not such a fool as you look."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks."
</p>

<p>
"Don't mention it, old chap, honestly I consider
you a smart chap; in fact, it begins to seem as if
there's not room on this earth for both you and I."  He
smiled in his happy, genial way, but his eyes were
taking in every movement of Carstairs' features.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, the earth is a big place, we can avoid each
other.  I'm going to Chilcombe to-morrow, and next
day up north again, I expect, but can't say for certain
till I get my letters.  I shall call to see your mater
when I'm that way."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, do!  Of course she need never know of
our little scrap, eh?"  Darwen's eyes had the same
old sparkle in them, and Carstairs with immobile face
and calm eyes was watching him as he watched an
engine under test.
</p>

<p>
"No, of course not!"
</p>

<p>
"By the way one of my old friends in the force
told me there was a burglary at some hotel here last
night."  His eyes flickered with a sunny smile as he
watched Carstairs' face.
</p>

<p>
"Ye-es, my hotel.  A drunken sailor climbed in
at one of the windows and left by the same
route."  Carstairs' face was almost expressionless.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  You didn't see the fun, then?"
</p>

<p>
"No, there wasn't much to see, I understand."
</p>

<p>
Darwen stepped up close and looked intently into
his eyes.  "Do you ever lie, Carstairs?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes! not, I think, frequently; as often
as you, for instance."  His face was sphinx-like
still.
</p>

<p>
"No, by God, I don't believe you could!  Decently!"  He
stepped back and laughed aloud.  "You've
neglected the most vital accomplishment of modern
life&mdash;to lie well.  Ta, ta, old chap, I wish we could be
pals."  He passed on with a happy smile and looked
up to the sun.  "The Lord has delivered him into
my hands," he said, to himself.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs rejoined Whitworth, and they returned to
the hotel.  After dinner, as they sat smoking, he said,
suddenly: "Would you like to catch that chap who
tried to rob you last night?"
</p>

<p>
"By Gad, I should like to give him a hiding."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs puffed his pipe in silence for a few moments,
his steady, shrewd eyes observing Whitworth closely.
"That man came to murder me, not to rob you," he
said, at length.
</p>

<p>
"Good God, man!  What are you talking about?"
</p>

<p>
"What I believe to be the truth.  Can you get
to-morrow off, and come home to my place with
me&mdash;that is, if you're game for a man hunt."
</p>

<p>
"Rather!  But I say&mdash;are you sure?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, er&mdash;reasonably.  The solution I have in
mind seems to satisfy most of the conditions of the
problem; we are up in the clouds somewhere, beyond
all rules.  The only methods for such problems are
trial and error.  Will you come?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet, but I must get a change of togs, first.
What time do you want to go?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, in the afternoon some time.  You can slip
over to your digs in the morning, and you might
bring your man, Hiscocks, if you can.  I'll get Bounce."
</p>

<p>
So it was settled, and at half-past three on Monday
afternoon, a select-party of four got into a third-class
carriage en route for Chilcombe.  Carstairs explained
the situation.  "We're going to catch a burglar,
that's all, but I want to keep him myself, that's why
I don't want the police brought into it.  I hope that
they'll come into action later for a double bag."
</p>

<p>
Bounce and the ex-marine nodded and asked no
questions.  They were trained that way, but
Whitworth leaned forward and spoke.  "I say, it's a
ghastly business you know, that&mdash;that <i>thing</i> was half
an animal, I'll swear it, he didn't speak a word, only
gave an animal sort of snarl, and his eyes as he
looked into my face were the eyes of a wild beast."  He
gave a little shudder.  "By God, we ought to kill
it on sight."
</p>

<p>
"We can't do that, you know, but we can stun it.
You saw that man who was killed at the vicarage
before, Bounce?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; mangled 'e was."
</p>

<p>
"I know.  I saw Donovan."  Carstairs puffed at
his pipe.  "Must be as strong as an elephant.  We'd
better stun him for a start."
</p>

<p>
They arrived at Chilcombe and Bounce and
Hiscocks put up at the village inn, while Carstairs
took Whitworth home.  It was a merry gathering
that night at the vicarage; Stanley Carstairs was
there, and the Bevengtons came in.  Whitworth was
as lively as a cricket, he kept the whole company
continually on the smile with his humour and endless
anecdotes of his navvies and other people he had met.
Jack Carstairs lay back in his chair and listened with
a steady smile.  He was watching Bessie Bevengton
and Whitworth and was rather glad he'd brought the
little man home.
</p>

<p>
It was after eleven when the party broke up, and
Jack took Whitworth to his bedroom.  "Here you
are," he said, handing him a heavy cudgel.  "I'll
meet you in the hall in half an hour's time."
</p>

<p>
"Alright.  I say, jolly evening.  Who's that girl?
Is she&mdash;engaged?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, one of the best, too.  We've been chums
since we were kids, so I know."
</p>

<p>
The little man whirled his cudgel round his head
thereby seriously endangering the furniture.  "We'll
flatten that beast out," he said, with extraordinary
fervour.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs laughed.  "In half an hour," he said,
and went to his room.  He turned the gas full on and
stood by the window for some minutes with the blind
up, in full view of the lawn and shrubbery below.
The sky was quite clear, and a full moon was climbing
up behind the distant Cotswold Hills.  The beauty of
the night enchanted him, this was his home, and many
memories thronged his brain as he gazed out at the
old familiar landscape silvered over with the soft,
romantic light of the moon.  For a moment he forgot
his mission, but a rustle of leaves among the evergreens
below and the hoot of an owl quite close at hand,
brought him back from the dim and distant past to
the pressing, urgent present.  He pulled down the
blind, picked up a book, and lay on the bed reading
for half an hour; then he got up, lighted a bull's-eye
dark lantern, turned out the gas, and crept softly
downstairs; a dark figure was sitting quietly on one
of the hall chairs, a big stick across its knees.  It was
Whitworth.  "This way," Carstairs said, softly, and
together they climbed quietly out of the back kitchen
window; they stood in the shadow of the wall for a
minute and looked round.  The lawn was flooded
with the soft moonlight, and the big chestnut tree
cast a shadow over the clump of laurel bushes near
where they stood.  Silently they flitted across the
narrow strip of moonlight and disappeared into the
dense shadow of the evergreens.  A hand stretched
out in the darkness and touched Carstairs on the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Is that you, Bounce?" he whispered, very low.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; nothing in sight yet."
</p>

<p>
"Alright.  Get along a bit further where you can
see my window.  Is Hiscocks there?"  Something
that seemed part of the wall murmured, "Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"This way then."  Carstairs moved forward and
stepped on a dry twig which snapped with a report
loud enough to wake the dead, so it seemed to their
tensed nerves.  Bounce stepped to the front.  "I
can see," he whispered, "used to the dark at sea."  They
moved round the shrubbery in single file, very
slowly, till they came to a point where they could
see the bedroom window, full in the moonlight, just
missed by the shade of the big chestnut tree.
</p>

<p>
They stood there for half an hour, peering out from
the darkness into the moonlight.  Suddenly they
heard something stirring in the big tree, and next
instant Whitworth gripped Carstairs by the arm.
"Good God!  Did you see that?"  Something, a
man or an animal, had shot out from the high branches
of the tree, and landed on the sill of Carstairs' bedroom
window.  They stood there motionless, gazing at the
thing on the window ledge, astonished, paralysed;
all except Bounce.  For one second only was he held
motionless, the next he was on the lawn throwing his
heavy stick at the window sill.  The thing turned as
the stick struck it, and looking down, snarled like an
angry dog; next minute it sprang on to the tree again
and disappeared, from sight.  That broke the spell,
and they all ran out.  "Don't shout!" Carstairs
whispered, hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
Before they were there the thing was down the tree
and racing across the grass on all fours.  They saw
Bounce fling himself on to it, and the next thing was
an indistinguishable tangle whirling about the lawn.
As they raced up the little sailor sprang clear and lashed
out with his fist.  The thing stood erect, and they saw
it was a hunchbacked man.  He rushed at Bounce
who stepped aside.  "Stand back!" he commanded
the others in a hoarse whisper.  "I'll tackle 'im."
</p>

<p>
He closed in and they heard the dull thud of a body
blow as the hunchback reeled back.  He charged
again, snarling angrily.  And again they heard a thud
as Bounce's bony knuckles came in contact with the
man's deformed breast bone.
</p>

<p>
Hiscocks raised his stick and rushed forward, but
the sailor motioned him back.  They circled round
each other in the moonlight, while the other three
stood silently by.  The weirdness of it seemed to have
cast a spell over all of them.  They saw the sailor step
in, they heard a gasping pant, and next minute the
hunchback dropped limply to the ground.  At once
Bounce bent over him, and pulling some cord from his
pocket tied up his wrists and ankles in his masterly,
definite manner.  "Quick," he whispered, "'e's such
a funny built bloke, I couldn't get at 'im afore."  He
stood up and putting his hand to his mouth sucked
it and spat.  "Bit me, 'e did," he observed.
</p>

<p>
"That's nasty."
</p>

<p>
"Yes!  Any'ow now we'll pack 'im up.  'Ave
you got the sack, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Next day, at half-past two in the afternoon, Carstairs
called at Darwen's office in London.  As soon as they
were alone, he produced a revolver.
</p>

<p>
"We captured a bit of property of yours last night,
Darwen."
</p>

<p>
"Ha!  Is that so?"  He sat down calmly in his
chair, toying with an ebony ruler, watching Carstairs
carefully, and smiling all the time.
</p>

<p>
"Put that ruler down; it's no use, your man has
gone back on you.  I'll give you twenty-four hours
to corpse yourself, however you like, otherwise I put
the police on you.  Before I leave this office I want a
written confession."
</p>

<p>
The brilliant eyes sparkled with amusement.
"Dear old Carstairs!  It's not bad for a first attempt,
but you were not built for a liar.  It needs practice,
Carstairs!  Constant practice.  That man is dumb.
I cut his tongue before I utilized him for these little
missions.  Ha!  Ha!  I'm always willing to learn
from the experience of others.  Old Donovan was
bowled out by a tongue, I removed it; swotted up
the literature on the subject, and removed it myself;
the human body is a fascinating machine, better than
greasy engines.  What's the next move, old chap?"  His
smile was the most charming he had ever worn.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs toyed with the revolver, keeping his eye
on him all the time.  "I think," he said, at length,
"that as a duty to civilization I ought to wipe you out
here and now."
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap, how absurd!  What's civilization
done for you?  Nothing!  Yes, by Jove, it has
though, a service of a negative value.  Civilization
has made you a poor man!  As a savage, you would
have been a chief!  Don't make yourself a bigger ass
than nature intended, Carstairs, old chap!  If I go,
you go too, and there's the girl, eh?  The girl we
scrapped over.  The girl who kissed you on the cheek; I
saw her do it, and you blushed like a kid.  She'd be left
all alone.  Now let's talk this matter over quietly."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs looked him steadily in the eyes, toying
meanwhile with the revolver.  "Do you know," he
said, "that that girl is your sister?"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>
HE LOOKED ROUND, TO MEET THE GRIM GREY EYES OF CARSTAIRS
</p>

<p>
Darwen doubled up with sudden laughter; in the
intensity of it he almost rolled into the fireplace.  A
sudden click pulled him up; he looked round solemnly
to meet the grim, grey eye of Carstairs gazing at him
along the revolver barrel; he had cocked it with his
thumb.
</p>

<p>
"Damn it!  You're not going to assassinate me,
old chap."
</p>

<p>
"Come away from that poker!  This is a six shot,
a Colt's forty-four, and every shot means a dead
man.  With it cocked as I have it, I can't miss at this
distance."
</p>

<p>
"By God, old chap, I'm proud of you.  You're
a credit to my up-bringing!  Impossible as it may seem
you are becoming day by day less and less of the fool
that you look."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you again that girl is your sister."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what the devil am I to do!  You won't
let me laugh."
</p>

<p>
"Then you don't believe it?"
</p>

<p>
He spread out his hands in a deprecating gesture.
"My dear Carstairs!"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs was thoughtful.  "No!  I suppose I
shouldn't believe it myself," he said.  "The man's
dead, I have no proof except my word.  Your mater
might&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Leave the mater out of it, Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
"Ye-es.  I think so too.  You're not fit to live
anyway, and you know my life won't be much to me
as long as you're alive."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so.  Quite so.  Still there's no need to get
personal over it.  There is not room for you and I
on this little globe.  That's it in a nutshell, isn't it?
One has to be eliminated, that's obvious; I'm a
generous sort of chap, but I can't oblige you in this.
I'm in love, yes, by God, in real love for the first and
only time.  I want that girl, also you want her!
We have fought with fists, and you won, but that is
not the finish.  I'm a sportsman; I'll go back a
hundred years with you and we'll fight a duel, eh?
A fair and square duel&mdash;to a finish."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs considered, watching him all the time.
"What with?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Anything you like.  I suggest rifles, magazine
rifles, to make a clean and engineering job of it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I may as well tell you that rifle shooting
has been my hobby for the past two years."
</p>

<p>
"Noble savage!  I won the Gascoign Cup myself."
</p>

<p>
"Alright, I'll take it at that.  Where shall it be?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, France! of course.  We'll cross to-morrow,
and open at a thousand yards.  We'll stalk each other
among the sand hills, just below Havre there.  How's
that for real sport, eh?"  He looked at Carstairs'
steady, thoughtful face with genuine admiration.
"By God, Carstairs, you're one of the best!  The
best.  It's a pity we crossed.  I suppose you're not
prepared to give up the girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Only to a better man, not to a blasted sweep like
you."
</p>

<p>
"No, quite so!  I should never under any circumstances
fight you with sledge hammers, Carstairs.
We'll cross to-morrow, or this evening then.  I think
the Havre boats only go at night.  Shall we go round
to Cook's together and book now?  Then we'll buy a
couple of rifles."  He was like a school boy at the
prospect of a holiday, the sporting spirit had bitten
very deeply into him.  "Come on, old chap," he said,
in the height of good humour, and they went out
together.  They had dinner together and journeyed
to Southampton together.  Carstairs, his hand on
the revolver in his coat pocket, never for one minute
taking his eyes off him.  They got aboard the little
steamer, and she cleared the dock at midnight.  They
paced the deck together, watching the receding lights
of the town; the sky was sprayed and flecked with
numberless little clouds, the moonlight shining through
the cracks, and ever and anon breaking out into full
power between the larger gaps.
</p>

<p>
As they walked together, and the Solent widened
out into the broad English Channel and the Island
faded from view, Darwen grew strangely pensive and
poetical.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, there's nothing like the sea, you know! the
sea, by moonlight!  Look at that!"
</p>

<p>
They stood together at the rail, and gazed out over
the tossing, tumbling waste of waters, Carstairs still
watchful, still suspecting treachery at any minute.
Darwen stood silently for some moments, then he
burst forth into poetry.
</p>

  'Ah,' once more I cried, 'Ye stars, ye waters,<br>
  On my heart your mighty charm renew;<br>
  Still, still let me, as I gaze upon you,<br>
  Feel my soul becoming vast like you!'<br>
</p>

<p class="poem">
  From the intense, clear, star-sown vault of Heaven,<br>
  Over the lit sea's unquiet way,<br>
  In the rustling night air came the answer:<br>
  Wouldst thou <i>be</i> as these are?  <i>Live</i> as they."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Do you hear that, Carstairs."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I like it."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, I always knew you had a soul somewhere,
deep down the abysmal depth of that great carcase of
yours.  Listen!  I'll finish it.

<p class="noindent">
Mark that, Carstairs.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'All the fever of some differing soul.'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Yes.  It's good."
</p>

<p>
"That is so.  It goes on:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Bounded by themselves, and unregardful<br>
  In what state God's other works may be,<br>
  In their own tasks all their powers pouring,<br>
  These attain the mighty life you see.<br>
</p>

<p>
  <p class="poem">
  A cry like thine in mine own heart I hear.<br>
  'Resolve to be thyself; and know that he<br>
  Who finds himself, loses his misery!'"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
He had spoken softly and slowly, but quite distinctly;
the silver cadence of his rich, cultured voice died
away, and they stood together in silence for some
minutes.
</p>

<p>
"In my opinion, Carstairs, that's one of the finest
things in the English language.  When I read that,
it seemed to express exactly what I had been vaguely
feeling for years past.  It contains the germs, the
kernel, of all the philosophy in the world.  'Resolve
to be thyself.'  Ye gods, think of that!  Define
'yourself,' Carstairs!  A German professor would fill
six volumes and then not do the job.  Matthew
Arnold does it in one.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Unaffrighted by the silence round them,<br>
  Undistracted by the sights they see,<br>
  In their own tasks all their powers pouring.'<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
There you are.  Take that to heart, Carstairs.  God
knows how much energy you've dissipated uselessly,
in thoughts on other people, hopes and fears.  Lord!
I've been as happy as a bird all my life.  That's true
religion, Carstairs.  I should like to have a talk with
your guv'nor on that.  He's a sound man, your guv'nor,
but with a weakness for worrying over other people's
troubles.  I never do, or very seldom.  'Keep fit,
and answer the impulses of your reason.'  That's
my motto."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs said nothing, but watched him closely.
He continued.  "I say 'I never worry over other
people's troubles,' you're the only man I've ever
worried over; honestly, Carstairs, you appeal to me
exceedingly.  I've often wondered whether you're
before your time or after, there is much of the noble
savage about you.  I regard you with awe, yet you
can think.  You use steam, and coal, and electricity;
but you totally disregard men and women.  This little
globe is just a box of bricks, you and I are part of
them&mdash;everything fits in&mdash;your duty here below is to
look after yourself, to fill your little niche efficiently."
</p>

<p>
Carstairs spoke.  "You do that best by considering
carefully your true relation to other people, the real
interdependence of every one, and the lubrication
of sentiment.  As an engineer you must know that
only the truth endures."
</p>

<p>
"By Jove, that's true.  'Because right is right,' etc.
As an individual you would shine, your conception
of the truth is very exact and your ability to act up
to it high.  As an engineer you are good, but this is
the age of states and municipalities, of diplomacy and
intrigue; when men are judged for what they say,
and not for what they do.  Had my lot been cast
among companies, instead of municipalities, I should
have had to entirely alter my tactics.  You can talk
to a man and smile at him till you're blue in the face,
but if he sees that your work don't pan out into
tangible dividends, you've got to go.  Municipalities
don't put much on dividends, they like a smile and a
loud voice.  If socialism comes to pass, your type
will die out and my type will flourish."
</p>

<p>
"God forbid."
</p>

<p>
"My dear chap, happiness is a condition of the
mind, not of the body.  I bet I've made more people
happy by my smile, than you have by your work.
Socialists are of two classes; wise men and fools
(the same as everybody else), the wise men want to
develop and get a good price for their natural powers
of persuasion, the fools are sentimental idiots who
propose to do away with misery by doing away with
individuals and the slums.  By Jove! the slums
are about the happiest places, slum-bred people
never commit suicide, when they feel depressed, they
go in for murder, a much more healthy occupation.
Garden mould is rotten-looking stuff, but the worms
enjoy it, and if you take 'em out and put 'em in nice,
clean cotton wool, they'll kick the bucket, and if
there were no worms, there'd be no men, you know.
At the present time, England is overflowing with
people who want to put the worms in cotton wool.
It's a question of religion; they have forsaken their
Gods.  I suppose there are some Christians in England,
I haven't met them, probably they could be counted
on the fingers of one hand.  England is a pagan
country still; your guv'nor is one of the best men
I've met, but he's a pure pagan: I'd give a hundred
to one in quids that if I slapped him on the right
cheek, he'd instantly plug me in the left eye&mdash;and his
entire congregation, also his Bishop, would back him
up.  The Englishman worships Thor, the magnified
man with the sledge hammer; I'm a Dago, I worship
those brainy old chaps who lived in the Pantheon;
they took life easily in the sun, and hadn't a moral
amongst them; I've rather a contempt for Thor, he
never showed any great brain capacity, but simply
slogged around blindly with a sledge hammer.  It's
a question of my Gods versus your Gods: A man's
religion is what he bases the conduct of his life on, not
which church he attends on Sunday: our stars were
in opposition from the start, Carstairs, and the moving
finger of Fate is approaching very rapidly to a blot&mdash;the
elimination of a unit, with large-bore magazine
rifles&mdash;and I don't think it'll be me."
</p>

<p>
He paused and gazed out over the sea.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs, watching him closely, was lost in admiration
of the beauty of his profile silhouetted against
the moon.
</p>

<p>
"The whole blooming world," he continued, "seems
to be slopping over with a sticky sort of sentiment.
The centre of gravity of civilization is becoming too
high, it'll topple over presently.  We have a new God
'The people' and the people are those thick-headed
fools one passes in the street: the artizan, who makes
things by the 'piece' (cheap and nasty), because he
can't be trusted to act on the square otherwise; he
gets more than his whack of the good things of life,
and puts the surplus into beer and baccy; his
'missus' would like to keep a servant, and objects
to bringing up kids.  Then there's the middle class
man, brought up with the ideas and the ambitions of
an aristocrat, the physique of a clerk, and the ability
of a navvy; his recreation is suicide: and the
aristocrats, I suppose, are those wishy-washy young men,
all nose and no chin, who loaf about the West End,
and die of ennui.  All due to excessive sentiment!
Sentiment is far more dangerous than drink or drugs:
in exceedingly small doses it adds to the flavour of
life.  Sentiment will get you out of a job quick enough,
but it'll never damn well get you into one.  You're
my best friend, I honestly like you and admire you,
but to-morrow I'm going to shoot you, afterwards I
shall be intensely sorry&mdash;for precisely five minutes.
Hullo!  Who the devil is this?"  His voice changed
to a note of anger.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs turned and saw something crawling,
creeping, sidling cautiously along the deck, like a dog
that knows he's done wrong.  It was the hunchback.
He got close up to Darwen, crouching down, and held
up his hands to view; the moon shone out suddenly
from behind a cloud, and they saw in the sudden
burst of light that the flesh was riven from hands and
wrists as though they had been wrenched through
something which was too small for them.
</p>

<p>
Darwen looked at him a moment, then, stooping
down, struck him across the face with his flat hand.
"You failed, and I have no use for failures; as an
intelligence department Sam failed&mdash;and he's gone; as an
executive, you have failed, too.  What use are you?"
</p>

<p>
Carstairs listened spellbound.
</p>

<p>
The hunchback gave a piteous moan and looked
up in Darwen's face with a singular, dog-like, appealing
look.  He stooped and struck him again in the face.
"You're a fool, I tell you, a useless fool."
</p>

<p>
With a sudden bound the thing leaped on to the
railing and over into the sea.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs sprang to the side, Darwen was looking
over like an eager boy.  "By Jove!" he said, "the
poor devil can't swim a stroke."  He vaulted lightly
on to the top of the broad handrail and stood for one
second balancing with the graceful ease of the practised
gymnast, then he dived after him.  "Stop the ship,
Carstairs," he said, as he went.  A sailor on the poop
threw a life belt overboard, and raised the alarm.
The ship was turned about, and went round in a circle
three times, but nothing was to be seen of either of
them, so she turned to her course again.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs leaned long over the side, gazing into the
dark water swirling past.  A great big "Why?"
confronted him.  "Why?  Why?  Why?" he
asked himself, and the answer was locked away, with
many another mystery, deep down in the depth of the
water at his feet.
</p>

<p>
For the rest of the night he paced the deck.  Next
day he gave all the information he could to the
authorities: the other passenger, they said, must
have been a stowaway, Carstairs thought so too.  He
took the train to Calais, and returned as quickly as
possible to break the news to Darwen's mother.
</p>

<p>
She had been up all night and was very haggard.
"Where's Charlie?" she asked, as soon as she saw
him.
</p>

<p>
"He's had an accident&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"He's dead!" she screamed, seizing him by the
hand and looking into his eyes.  "Dead!  Dead!
I knew it."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid he is."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my God!  My God!  Tell me, how was it?"
</p>

<p>
"We were going to Havre, he and I; he jumped
overboard in the night to rescue a stowaway."
</p>

<p>
She drew herself up with pride, the bleared eyes
shone with an unnatural light.  "There!  He was a
sportsman to the last!  He played wing three-quarter
for England when he was nineteen, and the same year
he scored fifty-six against the M.C.C.  I was so proud,
he was so handsome!  And now he's gone!  Oh, my
boy, my boy, my lovely boy!  Oh God, take me too."  She
fell forward on her face.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs picked her up and threw water over her;
he called a servant, and hurried out for a doctor.
</p>

<p>
She was dead&mdash;quite dead&mdash;her heart, the doctor said.
</p>

<p>
Carstairs went away and hurried north, he was a
day overdue as it was.  He explained the matter as
much as he could to the hard-headed ex-fitter.
</p>

<p>
"Ay!" the latter said, shaking his head, and there
was a world of sympathy in that shake of the head.
"It's a bad business, lad, a bad business."  He had
a commercial head equal to the best in the world, this
man, but his heart was exactly in the right place, too.
He broached the subject then to Carstairs that he was
going to retire, and offered him a much more important
position in the firm, which ultimately led (with the
great success of his many patents) to a partnership.
</p>

<p>
For six months or so he was kept hard at the grindstone,
external affairs troubled him not at all; he heard
that Bessie Bevengton was engaged to Whitworth, who
had got a good appointment on the staff of Sir Donald
Cox of Westminster; Bounce never ceased to marvel
at the manner in which the hunchback had broken out
of the double lashing he had put round his wrists;
his brother Stephen had got a picture hung in the
academy: all these things seemed to affect Jack
Carstairs like vague unimportant rumours, for he
knew, in his soul, that the girl was his, waiting for him,
and he wanted to go and fetch her: only, sometimes,
in the early morning, when the atmosphere outside
was some ten or fifteen degrees below freezing point,
and he wallowed in his cold bath, breathing deeply
and steadily through the nose, then with the
exhilarating reaction of his blood as he briskly wiped
down with a rough towel, these whispers from an
external world would find an echo in his brain.  "By
Jove, I must write and congratulate old Whitworth,"
or "Jolly glad Stephen's done something at last."
</p>

<p>
Then he got a spell, and went to London.  He
stayed with his artist brother.
</p>

<p>
"We'll go to the opera, and hear the new singer,"
the latter said on their first evening together.
</p>

<p>
"Who is she?" Jack asked.
</p>

<p>
"Madame Edith D'Arcy, daughter of the late Sir
Thomas D'Arcy, you know.  She's wonderful.
Perfect statue, and a marvellous voice."
</p>

<p>
"Let us go by all means.  Do you know her to speak
to?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, not exactly.  She's a protégée of Lady
Cleeve's, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Is that so?"
</p>

<p>
Before the performance was half over, Jack
surprised his brother by getting up and leaving his
seat.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"To see Edith."
</p>

<p>
"Who?"
</p>

<p>
"Madame Edith D'Arcy.  I'm going to marry her."
</p>

<p>
"Good Lord!"
</p>

<p>
"That's what I think, too; she's been dodging me
for years."  Carstairs was quite confident, his income
for the year had totalled considerably nearer £4000,
than the £400 stipulated by the autocratic old
aristocrat.
</p>

<p>
He sent up his card and was admitted to her dressing-room.
She was dressed in magnificent robes for the
part she was taking; he looked at her for some
moments, in silence, fascinated; she had attained the
full perfection of her beauty, and it was exceeding
rare; her eyes looked into his with a wondrous light.
Still in silence he stepped up close and took her hand,
then, much to his own astonishment, his great shoulders
bent forward, and he kissed the back of her fingers;
he had never imagined himself doing such a thing,
it was quite spontaneous.  He raised his head and
looked into her eyes.  "You are my queen," he said,
with a smile, and then he took her in his arms and
kissed her on the lips.
</p>

<p>
"So you've come," she said, "you've been a long
time&mdash;I&mdash;I wanted to do something."
</p>

<p>
"Ye-es!  That is the external&mdash;paradox, I
imagine," he answered, gazing steadily into the depths
of her eyes.  They were silent for some minutes.
The full tide of his deep, strong nature set to this
beautiful woman; the splendid purpose of life tingled
in his blood and shone out through his eyes as he gazed
into hers.  Only men like Carstairs feel such a tide.
He felt that this was the summit of his life.  "The
world was made for you and me," he said.
</p>

<p>
"There's the call," she answered, suddenly releasing
herself.  "I must go."
</p>

<p>
He stepped to the door and stood with his back to
it, the big bulk of him nearly filled it.  "No!  By
Jove, you won't!  Not this time."
</p>

<p>
"But I must," she said, "the manager will be
frantic."
</p>

<p>
"Show me the manager, and I'll flatten him out."
</p>

<p>
"Please let me go."
</p>

<p>
"Not till you promise to marry me to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow!  I can't."
</p>

<p>
"Alright, then, I'll burn this place down," he
produced a box of matches from his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be silly.  Let me go, please."
</p>

<p>
"Never again!"  He held a lighted match in his
hand.  "I'm willing to compromise; will you name
the day?"
</p>

<p>
"This time next year."
</p>

<p>
"Absurd!"  He held the match to some drapery
stuff near, and watched it slowly kindle.  "I'll give
you till this time next month."
</p>

<p>
"Two months?" she pleaded.
</p>

<p>
"Alright," he said, crumpling up the cloth in his
hands.  He produced her mother's ring from his
waistcoat pocket, and slipped it on her finger.  "That's
sealed then.  What's the price of the curtain?"
</p>

<p>
"Five pounds," she said, as she disappeared through
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Dirt cheap," he answered.  "I'd buy a hundred
at the same price."  And the audience, who were
competent to judge, said that Madame Edith D'Arcy
had never sung as she sang that night.
